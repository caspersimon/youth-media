# Youth media notes

Hi, nerd! If you're also in TAC and you would like to help by sharing your notes or improving the site, please feel free to open a pull request. The files in the content folder are the source material, so change that.

If you don't know what a pull request is, you can still help! Go into the content folder, download the file to the page you want to edit (or copy everything), then edit the file. I recommend editing via [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#)

Then send me an email with the changes you've made to 55_stickup.aldrin@icloud.com
