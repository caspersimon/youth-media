Based on the lecture transcript and slides from {week number}, please create a comprehensive overview of the key concepts discussed. If details about different effects for different youth (e.g., differences in developmental level, ethnicity, gender, mental wellbeing, or other traits that differ between people) are mentioned, always include those details. Organise the overview using bullet points and sub-bullets where appropriate. For each bullet point, predict how likely it is that the topic will be on the exam based on cues from the lecturer, such as statements like 'this is important to know,' 'keep in mind...,' or examples of potential exam questions. Indicate the likelihood using the following format:

- For topics unlikely to be on the exam, add nothing.
- For topics _somewhat likely_ to be on the exam, add **(A)**.
- For topics _very likely_ to be on the exam, add **(AA)**.
- For topics _extremely likely_ to be on the exam, add **(AAA)**.

Also, include a separate list of terms and acronyms from that week, marking those mentioned by the lecturer as potentially appearing on the exam with (AA).

This overview will be used for exam preparation, so ensure that it captures all essential information and is easy to understand.
