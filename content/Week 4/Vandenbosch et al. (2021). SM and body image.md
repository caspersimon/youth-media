Social media use and body image: what does the research say so far?
* There is a relationship
* This relationship is similar for boys and girls, even though boys engage in it less
* But, it is nuanced.

**There are 3 key trends in research:**
## 1. Type of platform matters (differential effects of social media platforms)
Physical appeareance-focused platforms lead to:
-       Appearance-comparison
-       Internalization of appearance ideals
-       Self-objectification

## 2. Features/activities of platform matters (unique social media activities)
It is not selfie postig per se, but
* engaging in the preparations for it (taking selfies, editing)
* preparing for the feedback: likes and comments of others.

## 3. Ambiguous effects of 'positive' social media content
### Fitspiration
* potential link to body dissatisfaction

### Body positivity
* some positive outcomes for young women
* Seems to depend on authenticity of poster

## What's next?
* disclaimers (e.g., whether image is edited or not)
* algorithms?

# Future research: more nuanced insights
1. Which social media use is relevant for your study? 
	* focus on content and activities, not just screen time
	* Which platforms? Multiple platforms?
2.  Varied samples
	* Diverse backgrounds
	* among younger groups
	* Most vulnerable groups
3. Varied methodology:
	* Experiments --> causality
	* Longitudinal studies --> long term effects
	* Uniformity --> Heterogeneity
4. Include positive and negative outcomes.
5. Expand underlying mechanisms
6. Intersections between offline and online behaviours
7. Driven by theory (not fear)

> 
> Authors: Laura Vandenbosch, Jasmine Fardouly, and Marika Tiggemann

> Publishing Year: 2022
> 
> This review article examines recent trends in research on social media's impact on body image, focusing on different platforms, unique social media features, and potentially positive content. The authors highlight three key trends:
> 
> ## Trend 1: Differential Effects of Social Media Platforms
> 
> Research suggests that visual platforms like Instagram and Snapchat are more strongly linked to negative body image than text-based platforms like Facebook and Twitter. This is attributed to the visual focus on physical appearance, leading to increased opportunities for social comparison, self-objectification (viewing oneself as an object), and internalization of unrealistic appearance ideals. Studies show that users spend more time making appearance comparisons on Instagram compared to Facebook.
> 
> ## Trend 2: Unique Social Media Activities
> 
> The user-generated nature of social media distinguishes it from traditional media. The creation, editing, and posting of selfies are examined. While posting selfies may not be inherently harmful, editing selfies consistently correlates with increased self-objectification and body dissatisfaction. Interestingly, simply taking selfies, even without posting, also leads to negative body image effects. The impact of likes and comments is also explored; positive appearance comments intensify the negative effects of exposure to idealized content. Viewing images with idealizing comments increases body dissatisfaction compared to viewing the same images with comments resisting appearance ideals or with no comments at all.
> 
> ## Trend 3: The Ambiguous Effects of 'Positive' Social Media Content
> 
> The article explores various forms of potentially positive content: fitspiration, disclaimer labels, and body positivity (BoPo) content. Fitspiration, while aiming to promote healthy lifestyles, often presents idealized and sexualized bodies, leading to increased body dissatisfaction. Disclaimer labels on digitally altered images have proven ineffective in preventing negative body image effects; some studies even suggest they may increase appearance comparisons. In contrast, body-positive content, especially visual BoPo content showcasing diverse bodies and promoting body acceptance, shows potential for improving body image. However, the sincerity and nature of BoPo content are crucial; self-promoting, commercial, or sexually objectifying BoPo can undermine its positive effects and even trigger negative ones. The authors note concerns about BoPo content that is self-promoting, contains commercial messages, uses enhancing filters, and is sometimes sexually objectifying.
> 
> ## Recommendations for Future Research
> 
> The authors suggest several directions for future research: exploring the impact of other social media features (e.g., ephemeral content, connection strength, algorithms); examining other psychological mechanisms beyond self-objectification and appearance comparison (e.g., internalization, social reinforcement); investigating individual differences moderating the relationship between social media use and body image; and considering how different social media activities may impact various psychological mechanisms.

>     
> 4. Positive appearance comments on selfies intensify negative body image effects.
>     
> 5. Fitspiration content often backfires, increasing body dissatisfaction despite its intention to promote healthy lifestyles.
>     
> 6. Disclaimer labels on idealized images are largely ineffective in mitigating negative body image impacts.
>     
> 7. Body-positive (BoPo) content, particularly visual content showing diverse bodies and promoting body acceptance, shows promise for improving body image.
>     
> 8. The sincerity and presentation of BoPo content are critical; self-promotional or objectified BoPo can be detrimental.

> 10. Research needs to examine psychological mechanisms beyond self-objectification and appearance comparison.
>     
> 11. Individual differences that moderate the relationship between social media use and body image should be investigated.
