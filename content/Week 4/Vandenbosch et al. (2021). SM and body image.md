Social media use and body image: what does the research say so far?
* There is a relationship
* This relationship is similar for boys and girls, even though boys engage in it less
* But, it is nuanced.

## Type of platform matters
Physical appeareance-focused platforms lead to:
-       Appearance-comparison
-       Internalization of appearance ideals
-       Self-objectification

## Features/activities of platform matters
It is not selfie postig per se, but
* engaging in the preparations for it (taking selfies, editing)
* preparing for the feedback: likes and comments of others.

## What about positive content?
### Fitspiration
* potential link to body dissatisfaction

### Body positivity
* some positive outcomes for young women
* Seems to depend on authenticity of poster

## What's next?
* disclaimers (e.g., whether image is edited or not)
* algorithms?

# Future research: more nuanced insights
1. Which social media use is relevant for your study? 
	* focus on content and activities, not just screen time
	* Which platforms? Multiple platforms?
2.  Varied samples
	* Diverse backgrounds
	* among younger groups
	* Most vulnerable groups
3. Varied methodology:
	* Experiments --> causality
	* Longitudinal studies --> long term effects
	* Uniformity --> Heterogeneity
4. Include positive and negative outcomes.
5. Expand underlying mechanisms
6. Intersections between offline and online behaviours
7. Driven by theory (not fear)
