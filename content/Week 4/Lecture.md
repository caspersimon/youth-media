%%Notes stolen from Roshan. Thank you%%

A lecture all about social media! Cool. Let's start with some cool facts and definitions.

## Social media profile ownership
consequences for user experience, long term:
* Imagine Adam, who is 8 years old
* He signs up on X, with a fake birthday to make it seem like he is 13
* In 5 years time, he is 13, but now X thinks he is 18 years old
* At 18 years old, X starts to show you porn
And this happens a lot! Most teenagers in the US have seen porn accidentally.

## Developmental psychology
* [Preteens](Definitions/Age%20ranges/tweens.md) start to develop social antenna
* From age 7/8 onwards, children start to describe themselves abstractly and their self-concept becomes more stable
* Relationships with others become increasingly central to the self-definitions of [preteens](Definitions/Age%20ranges/tweens.md)
* popularity becomes more important

## [Middle childhood](Definitions/Age%20ranges/middle%20childhood.md): social media activities

* During developmental stage most kidsâ€™ social circle does not reach beyond family and a few close friends (we do not know about their online self presentation practices e.g. how they are presenting their platforms)
	* Social media relatively unpopulated
	* Social media use = other media use habits
	* Small circle --> passive media use

* Youtube is killing traditional TV for kids. Kids account for 30% of YouTube viewership.

**Should we discuss kids when talking about social media?**
YES! Because:
* social media matches development goals
* in spite of age restrictions, under 13 year olds still use social media
* some children are younger (individual differences)
* "sillicon valley has discovered kids"

### PopJam do's and donts
#### DO:
* create a profile
* create art 
* view, heart, and comment
* get followers

* watch videos
* add, search for and invite friends 

#### Don't
* communicate using private chat
* upload or share photos or selfies or images revealing their faces, their friends' facebook

### Why should we be careful about children using social media?
12-15 year olds:
13% said that gaining more followers is more important than keeping information private

58% think they can easily delete information they have posted about themselves online (which is not true)
