> Literature reviews on how social media use affects adolescent mental health have accumulated at an unprecedented rate of late. Yet, a higher-level integration of the evidence is still lacking. We fill this gap with an up-to-date umbrella review, a review of reviews published between 2019 and mid-2021. Our search yielded 25 reviews: seven meta-analyses, nine systematic, and nine narrative reviews. Results showed that most reviews interpreted the associations between social media use and mental health as ‘weak’ or ‘inconsistent,’ whereas a few qualified the same associations as ‘substantial’ and ‘deleterious.’ We summarize the gaps identified in the reviews, provide an explanation for their diverging interpretations, and suggest several avenues for future research

Title: Social media use and adolescent mental health

Authors: Patti M. Valkenburg, Adrian Meier, Ine Beyens

Publishing Year: 2022

This umbrella review synthesizes findings from 25 recent reviews examining the relationship between social media use (SMU) and adolescent mental health. The authors highlight inconsistencies in definitions and methodologies across the reviewed studies, emphasizing the need for clearer conceptualizations of SMU and mental health outcomes.

## Conceptualizations of SMU and Well-being

A major challenge identified is the inconsistent definition of SMU across studies. Some reviews used broad terms like "digital media use" or "technology use," while others focused on specific platforms or activities. Similarly, the definition of mental health and well-being varied considerably, sometimes encompassing a wide range of outcomes beyond typical measures of mental health (e.g., academic performance, drug use). The lack of consistent definitions hinders the comparability of results and makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions.

## Main Findings of the Reviews

Meta-analyses generally showed weak associations between SMU and adolescent well-being and ill-being. Some found small to moderate associations between SNS use and higher levels of ill-being (e.g., depressive symptoms), while others found weak associations with higher levels of well-being or no significant association. The inconsistencies highlight the complexity of the relationship and the limitations of relying solely on aggregate-level statistics. Systematic and narrative reviews largely agreed that the effects of SMU are small and inconsistent across studies, although some reviews used stronger, less nuanced language to describe the findings.

## Identified Gaps in the Literature and Avenues for Future Research

The authors identify several critical gaps in the literature. A primary concern is the overwhelming reliance on cross-sectional data, which prevents establishing causality. Furthermore, there is a lack of attention to mediators that could explain the associations between SMU and mental health, and a lack of focus on risk and protective factors that may explain individual differences in susceptibility to the effects of SMU. Other gaps include over-reliance on self-report measures, small and homogenous samples, and a lack of attention to the content and quality of SM interactions. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies, explore mediators and moderators, utilize more objective measures of SMU, and consider the content of interactions, rather than just overall time spent. Methodological advances like within-person analyses are also encouraged to move beyond aggregate-level findings.

## Discussion: Crucial Avenues for Future Research

The authors emphasize the need for consistent definitions of SMU and mental health outcomes. The use of imprecise terminology obscures the complexities of the relationship and hinders the understanding of how different types of SMU may have different effects. They also call for a shift from relying on simply time spent on SM to considering the content and quality of interactions. This could involve using more objective measures like log-based data or methods that capture the content of SM interactions (e.g., analyzing screenshots or data downloads). Finally, they highlight the need to address inconsistent interpretations of effect sizes by embracing person-specific approaches that consider individual differences in susceptibility to SMU’s effects.

# Important Take-Aways

1. Inconsistent definitions of SMU and mental health outcomes hamper the interpretation of results.
    
2. Most studies are cross-sectional, preventing causal inferences.
    
3. Meta-analyses show weak to moderate associations between SMU and both well-being and ill-being, but the direction and strength are inconsistent.
    
4. The effects of SMU are likely small and inconsistent across studies.
    
5. There is a need for longitudinal studies to establish causal relationships.
    
6. Mediators (e.g., social comparison, cyberbullying) should be investigated to explain the associations.
    
7. Moderators (e.g., personality traits, social support) should be investigated to understand individual differences in susceptibility.
    
8. Over-reliance on self-report measures may introduce bias.
    
9. The quality of SM interactions is likely a more important predictor than time spent.
    
10. Objective measures of SMU (e.g., log-based data) are needed.
    
11. Within-person analyses can provide valuable insights into individual-level effects of SMU.
    
12. The content and quality of SM interactions should be examined, not just the quantity.
    
13. Different types of SMU (e.g., active vs. passive, public vs. private) may have different effects.
    
14. A person-specific approach is needed to understand individual differences in susceptibility to SMU's effects.
    
15. Inconsistencies in interpretations of effect sizes reflect the complexity of the relationship and limitations of aggregate-level statistics.
    
16. Future research should focus on understanding when, why, and for whom SMU leads to positive or negative effects.
    
17. Personalized prevention and intervention strategies are needed based on individual differences.
    
18. More research is needed on the potential positive effects of SMU on adolescent mental health.
    
19. Methodological improvements, including larger samples and more sophisticated data analysis techniques, are crucial.
    
20. Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to address the complexity of this topic.
    
21. The 'screen time' approach provides only a limited understanding of the effects of SMU.
    
22. Considering the role of problematic SMU is vital, as it's more than just excessive time spent.
    
23. There is a need to move away from general screen time to a more nuanced understanding of how specific types of social media use affect mental health.
    
24. More research is needed on the impact of various social media platforms on adolescent mental health.
    
25. The impact of social media content on adolescent mental health is a key area for future research.
    
26. Understanding the interplay between social media use, offline relationships, and mental health is crucial.
    
27. The role of social comparison and cyberbullying in mediating the relationship between social media use and mental health needs further study.
    
28. Research should consider the influence of cultural context on the relationship between social media use and mental health.
    
29. There is a need for more research on effective interventions to mitigate the potential negative effects of social media use on adolescent mental health.
