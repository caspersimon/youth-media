They write about the developments of young elementary school children (5-7 years) and of preadolescents (8-12) and how that development impacts the media they use and also why they collect skylanders and pokemon cards.


### [Young Elementary Schoolchildren](Definitions/Age%20ranges/young%20elementary%20schoolchildren.md) (5-7 years)
This is considered a transitional time. [[Definitions/Piaget]] said these kids are still in the preoperational stage though. Still, they have perceptual boundedness, but this tendency has largely disappeared at age 9. 5 year-olds also still do centration, but by the age of 9 they can take in multiple details at once. They also learn to understand stories better, and they’ll be able to understand flashbacks and stuff. So, during this period, they really start to become a whole lot less dumb!

However, they still might have trouble distinguishing realistic from unrealistic media content, but their skills improve as they do less centration and perceptual boundedness. Like, they’ll understand that Big Bird is someone in a costume, they don’t really believe in Santa anymore (but aren’t sure whether he is fake). Some kids will take this scepticism a step further and start to believe everything on TV is fake.

Many kids still don’t really know the difference between fiction and real life. They would, for example, believe that Phil from modern family also is a realtor in real life, and that they are also a family when the camera’s aren’t rolling (which is something that many 9/10 year olds still believe).

5 year olds are somewhat similar, but also very different from 3 year olds. They can concentrate on something they are interested in for up to an hour(!), compared to just 20 minutes for 3-year olds. They can also focus on games for a long time. This better concentration enables them to watch feature-length films! They also like structure and rules better, like when they play a new game their first aim is to learn the rules.

How kids of this age use media:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Activity|Average Time Spent (minutes/day)|
|Watching television or movies|Nearly 70 minutes|
|Playing electronic games|30|
|Reading books or comic books|25|

  

#### Humour Preferences

[[Definitions/Age ranges/toddlers]] and [preschoolers](Definitions/Age%20ranges/preschoolers.md) like clownish, physical and innocent humour. From age 5, they develop language skills that unlock them using more humour types. See the table below

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Humour Type|Examples|
|Verbal Humour (Riddles and word games)|Why are frogs so happy? Because they eat whatever bugs them.|
|Conceptual Incongruities|What do you get when you mix a cow and a duck? Milk and quackers!|
|Naughty, Socially Unacceptable|Jokes about human excrement (e.g., Walter the Farting Dog, Everyone Poops)|

#### Gender and Toys and Videogames

Children in this transitional period become aware of their gender roles and develop rigid ideas about what members of their sex can do. As they spend more time in separate groups, they feel pressure to conform to gender-appropriate behaviour. Toy manufacturers, media developers, and advertisers capitalise on these notions, creating gender-specific products.

Gender-role stereotyping is evident in children’s toy stores, with “pink” and “blue” sections. Commercials also reinforce rigid gender roles. A study analysed over six hundred commercials targeting youth and found that boys’ commercials offered a different world from girls’. For instance, 76% of boys’ commercials featured action and adventure, compared to only 12% of girls’ commercials. Boys’ commercials also focused on sports (13%) while girls’ commercials emphasised nurturing, physical attractiveness, friendship, and affection for animals.

Studies of Dutch children reveal that popular games like Minecraft, Super Mario Bros., and Subway Surfers are not unique to the Netherlands but are widely enjoyed across Western countries. Notably, four games appear on both boys’ and girls’ favorite games lists: Minecraft, Subway Surfers, Mario Kart, and Super Mario. However, closer examination reveals gender-specific differences. Girls prefer activities like dressing up dolls (Barbie), dancing (Just Dance), creating movie stars (MovieStarPlanet), and caring for pets (Pou), while boys enjoy racing, action, and sports games like Cars, Skylander, and FIFA.

### Preadolescents (8-12 years): concrete-operational thinkers

Preadolescents, aged eight to twelve, differ from younger counterparts in several ways. According to [[Definitions/Piaget]], they are concrete-operational thinkers, using a system of rules and logic. Unlike younger children, they understand that event order can be reversed. For instance, they grasp “conservation tasks,” where they recognize that the amount of water remains the same despite the container’s size change. However, they can only apply their logic to concrete objects or events, unlike formal-operational thinkers who can think logically about abstract concepts. Preadolescents also exhibit “decentering,” scrutinising every aspect of an object or information, unlike younger children who focus on the most striking aspects. For example, when given new shoes, they dissect and evaluate every detail, from the laces to the logo.

Concrete-operational thinking drives children to compare everything around them to genuine standards. They become more critical of parents, friends, family, commercials, games, and TV programs that lack action or newsworthiness. Special effects and fantasy characters no longer impress them, as they realize they can’t compensate for a boring story. Children can now multitask, and nearly 30% of preadolescents use other media while watching TV.

#### Collect Them All!

Why do [[Definitions/Age ranges/tweens]] feel this need to collect (e.g., sports paraphernalia (e.g., baseball cards), media heroes (e.g., Pokemon cards, Disney Infinity cards), or toys (e.g., Beanie Babies)? Children of this age are concrete-operational thinkers. They have an eye for details and feel a need to follow rules and order their surroundings. Saving and collecting objects involve new concrete operations like grouping, ordering, classifying, and categorising. Unlike younger children, they can group objects by multiple criteria.

Capitalism has found a way to exploit this! Media content popular with this age group often includes collecting elements. Virtual gaming worlds like Club Penguin, Minecraft (which involves sorting of items), and Webkinz attract members of this age group. Toy and media conglomerates often market associated products to this audience. The phrase “collect them all!” is common in their ads.

Pokemon cards, for example, are also fun because they allow for social interaction like trading the cards

#### Magical Realism

Kids are now more interested in real people (like sports heroes) than fantasy characters in media and toys. This change occurs a bit earlier for girls compared to boys. 

It’s not that they no longer enjoy fantasy per se, but they want fantasy that’s logically consistent. Harry Potter or Wizards of Waverly Place are good examples. Here, the main characters have real (relatable) emotions, and other experiences (love, competition, jealousy) are realistically depicted.

#### They Become Snobs (i.e., they start to care about production quality)

Social skills become a lot better from age 7. They will become better at recognising and understanding others’ (complex) emotions.

With these new social skills, combined with their heightened interest in details and realism, these kids become a picky audience. They’ll recognise bad acting, they’ll dislike it when something implausible happens, or when a product in a commercial is presented in a fantasy context.

#### Identification with Media Characters

Kids before age 6 are “egocentric” according to [[Definitions/Piaget]]. They literally aren’t aware that other people’s perceptions exist. They will talk to themselves, for example.

By the age of 8, kids have learned that peers might have similar or other interests, and start to look for friends who are psychologically similar to themselves.

As they gain more understanding that other people can be psychologically similar to themselves, they also gain interest in media characters that are not only physically similar to them, but also psychologically. By watching those characters, they might observe situations that might be relevant to their own lives.

They prefer actors that are at least their own age, and teenagers and adults even more (because they do more interesting activities and are better actors).

#### Need to Belong

As kids’ [[Definitions/Development types|social-emotional development]] becomes more complex, their interactions with others also become more complex. They will have a greater ability to interact with and share similar experiences with others. They will become more sensitive to the opinions of others during this period. They will also become more committed and loyal to a group to which they belong. They will avoid the wrong clothing or media content, and avoid media content that is considered too “childish.”

#### Gender differences

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Gender|Entertainment Preferences|Reasons|
|Boys|Action, violence, sports, science fiction, adventure, cartoons|Feel ‘cool’ and grown-up, enjoy masculine action heroes|
|Girls|Realistic dramas, stories about families, attractive characters|Value clear storylines, scared by action, violence, and horror|
