Basically this text is about everything that adolescents go through! we are interested in young teens (12-15 years old) and older teenagers (16-19 years old)

# Adolescents
%%The text below was generated using NoteBookLM%%

Chapter 6 examines the role of media in the lives of adolescents. **Adolescence is a period of significant cognitive and [[Definitions/Development types|social-emotional development]], and these changes impact how teens use and interact with media.** The chapter explores these developmental shifts, noting the unique cognitive abilities and social needs of teens in both early (12-15 years old) and late (16-19 years old) adolescence.
## Formal operational stage
%%Info under this header generated by llama3.3 with acces to the book%%
The formal operational stage, according to Jean [[Definitions/Piaget]]'s theory of [[Definitions/Development types|cognitive development]], is characterized by:

- The ability to think logically and reason abstractly
- The capacity for hypothetical-deductive reasoning
- The ability to consider multiple perspectives and evaluate evidence
- The development of a sense of morality and ethics
- The ability to plan and organize complex tasks

This stage typically occurs during adolescence and early adulthood, around 12-15 years old. During this stage, individuals can think about abstract concepts, evaluate information, and make decisions based on logical reasoning.

In the context of media preferences, formal operational thinkers are likely to prefer more complex and realistic content, such as movies or TV shows with intricate plots and character development. They may also be more critical of poorly produced media content and have a greater appreciation for nuanced storytelling.

## Vygofsky

Lev Vygotsky's theory, unlike Jean [[Definitions/Piaget]]'s, emphasized the role of social interaction in [[Definitions/Development types|cognitive development]]. According to Vygotsky, children learn through collaborative dialogue with more knowledgeable others, a process he called the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). This means that children learn best when they are working alongside someone who can provide guidance and support as needed.

In contrast, [[Definitions/Piaget]]'s formal operational stage is characterized by logical reasoning, hypothetical-deductive thinking, and a sense of morality. However, Vygotsky's theory suggests that this stage may not be solely the result of individual [[Definitions/Development types|cognitive development]], but rather the outcome of social interactions and collaborative learning experiences.

Key differences between Jean [[Definitions/Piaget]]'s formal operational stage and Lev Vygotsky's theory include:

- **Focus**: [[Definitions/Piaget]]'s theory focuses on individual [[Definitions/Development types|cognitive development]], while Vygotsky's theory emphasizes the role of social interaction in [[Definitions/Development types|cognitive development]].
- **Learning process**: [[Definitions/Piaget]] suggests that children learn through active experimentation and discovery, whereas Vygotsky proposes that children learn best when working alongside more knowledgeable others.
- **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)**: Vygotsky's concept of the ZPD highlights the importance of collaborative learning experiences in [[Definitions/Development types|cognitive development]].

## Early Adolescence
- The chapter begins by highlighting the **significant changes that occur in the brain during early adolescence, specifically in the prefrontal cortex.**
- The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions such as planning, decision-making, and impulse control. **Because this part of the brain is still maturing during adolescence, teens may be more likely to engage in risky behaviours, including risky media use.**
- Crone and Konijn (2018) also examine these brain developments in adolescence, and they note the importance of the social context for these changes.
- **The changes in the dopamine system during adolescence also impact teens' media choices.** **Experiences that trigger dopamine release — such as listening to music, playing games, and spending time with friends — are more rewarding for teens than they are for children and adults.** **This increased sensitivity to dopamine may explain why teens are drawn to media content that is fast-paced, exciting, and stimulating.**
- Beyond these changes in their brains, teens are also **undergoing significant social and emotional changes.** They are **developing their identities, exploring their sexuality, and navigating their relationships with peers and family.** **Social media and other forms of media play an important role in this process, allowing teens to connect with others, experiment with different identities, and learn about social norms.** The chapter also emphasizes the importance of plausible content for this age group.

## Late Adolescence
- As adolescents move into late adolescence, **the development of executive functions continues, and teens become better able to regulate their emotions and control their impulses.**
- Socially, **late adolescence is marked by an increased focus on intimate relationships and a decreased focus on popularity and status.**

## Conclusion

The chapter concludes by noting that **while media can pose some risks for adolescents, it also offers many opportunities for learning, growth, and connection.** The authors of _Plugged In_ emphasize that **media effects are complex and depend on a variety of factors**, including the individual characteristics of the teen, the content of the media, and the social context in which the media is used.
