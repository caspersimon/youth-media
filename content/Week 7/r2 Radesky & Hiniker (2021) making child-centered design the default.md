### Introduction
Many discussions about children’s digital media use center on individual responsibility: parents should limit “screen time,” teens should self-moderate, etc. Such an approach neglects a broader perspective. Evidence from public health suggests that changing environments at a systemic level—rather than focusing solely on individual behavior—leads to more profound, equitable, and sustainable improvements in child wellbeing.

**Core idea:** A similar shift is needed for children’s digital media. Instead of expecting families to navigate complex, profit-driven platforms and filter out harmful content themselves, we should focus on making child-centered design the default setting within platforms. This new paradigm treats platforms and policy as levers for large-scale positive change, removing pressure from parents and ensuring all children have access to respectful, developmentally appropriate digital experiences.

### Rationale for the Paradigm Shift
#### Creating environments with child-centered defaults
Just as public health interventions remove harmful substances from children’s surroundings, digital platforms can adopt “optimal defaults” that inherently support children’s wellbeing. Rather than leaving curation to parents alone, platforms can be designed so that safe, enriching options are what children encounter first.

> [!info]+ Public Health Analogy  
> For decades, interventions like removing lead from paint or replacing sugary drinks in schools have shown that altering environments produces better outcomes than telling individuals to change their habits. Similarly, if platforms prioritize healthy defaults, children’s digital well-being improves without constant parental policing.

#### Individual responsibility and intensive parenting
The dominant narrative places the burden on parents to control kids’ screen use. This intensifies parenting pressures, fostering guilt and anxiety, and favors wealthier families who can invest more time or resources. A child-centered defaults approach frees parents from continually policing tech use and ensures all children benefit, regardless of socioeconomic status.

#### Industry incentive structures
Current platform incentives prioritize engagement and advertising revenue over children’s welfare. By setting engagement (time, clicks) as the metric of success, platforms inherently push content that may not align with kids’ developmental needs. Shifting to child-centered design means redefining success metrics so platforms highlight balanced, age-appropriate, culturally diverse, and respectful content.

### Operationalizing the Paradigm Shift
#### Opportunities for platform developers
Platforms are the gatekeepers of what children see. If they:
- Acknowledge children as a user group with unique needs
- Integrate developmentally informed metrics into recommendation algorithms
- Promote diverse, high-quality content
- Limit predatory design and addictive UI elements

They can create a healthier, more constructive digital ecosystem. For example, using personalization to guide kids toward varied, meaningful activities and offering natural stopping points would help children self-regulate their digital habits.

> - Replace autoplay with prompts encouraging reflection or offline play.  
> - Elevate videos from BIPOC creators portraying rich cultural experiences.  
> - Ensure ads are unobtrusive, relevant, and minimal.

#### Opportunities for policymakers
Current U.S. tech regulation often lags behind children’s needs, focusing on extreme harms rather than everyday design choices. International models, like the UK’s Age-Appropriate Design Code, show how legislation can promote default child-centered norms. Policymakers can:
- Mandate transparency in algorithms
- Incentivize platforms to adopt well-being metrics
- Enforce data minimization and privacy

This systemic shift reduces inequities: all children benefit from improved environments, not just those with resourceful parents.

#### Opportunities for researchers
Academics can move beyond studying “screen time” to investigate how design features shape outcomes. Interdisciplinary work with child development experts, designers, and industry could identify new indicators of well-being (e.g., content diversity, empathy-building interactions) and measure their impact at scale.

> [!info]- New Research Paths  
> Researchers might explore:
> - Which platform features best support self-regulation in children?
> - How to operationalize “positive ethnic-racial representation” and encourage its presence?
> - Ways to measure if children transfer digital learning to real-life skills.

Such inquiries will yield evidence-based guidance for industry and create accountability frameworks ensuring platforms serve kids, not just investors.

### Conclusion
The current landscape places too much responsibility on individual families while platforms thrive on engagement-based models. A systemic shift, guided by child-centered defaults, can reshape online environments so that beneficial content and balanced digital usage become the norm rather than the exception.

This vision requires collaboration:
- **Platforms:** Implement child-centered defaults and measure success by kids’ well-being, not mere engagement.
- **Policymakers:** Update laws to align industry incentives with children’s interests.
- **Researchers:** Go beyond screen time to develop concrete well-being metrics and partner with companies to refine platform ecosystems.

By working together, we can move from a moral panic about “screen time” and parental failures to a systemic solution that supports every child’s healthy development.

## From moral panic to systemic change: Making child-centered design the default (Full Summary with Callouts)

### Introduction
For years, conversations about children and digital media have focused on "screen time" and parental responsibility. But this narrow lens overlooks the systemic nature of the digital ecosystem kids inhabit. Parallels to public health interventions show that focusing on changing environments rather than individual habits results in more equitable, impactful improvements in well-being.

**Key shift:** Rather than expecting parents to shield kids from problematic design, we must design platforms so that supportive, respectful, developmentally fitting content is the default. This aims to reduce parental burdens, promote equity, and support children’s healthy growth online.

> [!info]+ The Public Health Model  
> Public health measures demonstrate that altering the environment (e.g., banning trans fats) leads to widespread, sustained improvements. Apply that logic to children’s digital spaces: if we shift platform architecture to prioritize children’s interests, large-scale positive outcomes follow.

### Rationale for the Paradigm Shift
#### Creating environments with child-centered defaults
Children depend on their environments. Bad design—like addictive loops, hyper-commercialization—harms them. Shifting to child-centered defaults means embedding positive experiences at the ecosystem level.

#### Individual responsibility vs. systemic approach
Current norms burden parents with constant vigilance, intensifying “intensive parenting.” This approach is inequitable: wealthier families cope better, while marginalized groups suffer. Systemic improvements—like safe digital defaults—benefit all children equally.

#### Industry incentive structures
Platforms profit from engagement, often at odds with child-centered values. A new framework aligned with developmental science would redefine success, encouraging platforms to embrace metrics that measure child well-being and diversity of experiences rather than pure watch time.

### Operationalizing the Paradigm Shift
#### Opportunities for platform developers
Platforms can:
- Identify kids as a distinct audience with unique needs.
- Train recommendation systems on well-being metrics (e.g., diversity, empathy, educational value) instead of time watched.
- Integrate friction to encourage healthy disengagement cycles, letting kids step away naturally.
- Limit aggressive ads and data harvesting.

> - Replace autoplay with reminders: “Want to try something else?”  
> - Elevate channels that highlight cultural authenticity, language learning, positive BIPOC roles.  
> - Provide resource hubs for parents or educators to find vetted, enriching content.

#### Opportunities for policymakers
Legislative frameworks must move beyond addressing crises and embrace holistic child digital rights. If laws require child-centered design as a baseline, platforms must comply, resulting in a universal lift in content quality and safety.

> - Restrict manipulative monetization practices targeting kids.  
> - Set standards for representation, cultural respect, and minimal data sharing.

#### Opportunities for researchers
Academics can:
- Develop new measures of “positive child outcomes” from digital media.  
- Conduct longitudinal studies to see if platform-level changes improve mental health, cultural awareness, academic growth.
- Work closely with industry to trial and refine platform modifications.

> - How do different cultural contexts influence what "child-centered" means in digital spaces?

### Conclusion
Shifting responsibility from parents’ endless vigilance to systemic design improvements can address media’s influence on kids at scale. By focusing on platforms, we tackle root causes rather than symptoms.

This collaboration among developers, lawmakers, and research-ers can replace “moral panic” and blame with proactive, empathic, and evidence-based strategies. The result: a more inclusive, supportive digital world that children deserve.
