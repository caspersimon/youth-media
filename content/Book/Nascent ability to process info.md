Children’s preferences for the familiar can be attributed to their nascent ability to process information. From two to five years of age, their memory span (that is, the list of numbers or words that they can retain in shortterm memory) doubles in capacity, and the speed at which they process information increases proportionally. Despite these cognitive advances, much information is still too complex for young children. Why is this? Compared to older children, they have fewer experiences to which they can relate new information. In the literature, it is sometimes said that young children’s responses are stimulus driven, whereas older children’s responses are more schema driven. Compared with their younger peers, older children have more knowledge to help them select, encode, organize, and process new information.
