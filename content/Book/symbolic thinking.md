From age two onward, children deal with media entirely differently from how they did before. [Piaget](Definitions/Piaget.md) called the period between two and six the preoperational stage. This stage is characterized by symbolic thinking—the ability to use a symbol to stand for something that is not there. Such a symbol can be a drawing of a specific event, or a box that the child uses as a boat. Children must develop symbolic thinking in order to engage in the activities of the preoperational stage, such as imitation, drawing, and pretend play. [Piaget](Definitions/Piaget.md) called children’s thinking in this stage _pre-operational because unlike operational thinking, which characterizes middle childhood, preoperational thinking is not yet logical or tied to the law of cause and effect.
