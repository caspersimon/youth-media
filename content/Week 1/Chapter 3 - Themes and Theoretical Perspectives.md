Basically this chapter consists of reviewing the research about media effects on youth from the 20th century onwards.

### The Payne Fund Studies
These were the first guys who actually did some research on the effects of media on children. They did 12 studies between 1929 and 1933. They did a bunch of–what we would now call–content analyses, qualitative studies, and lab experiments. They found out that films can be categorised in 10 major themes (crime, sex, love, comedy, mystery, war, children (about or for), history, travel, and social propaganda; p. 32) and the big 3 were of course love, crime, and sex. What was really interesting is that they found (unsurprisingly) that media effects were different for different people! However, they didn’t really have time to really dive deep into this (like they still believed the [Hypodermic needle](Definitions/theories/Hypodermic%20needle.md) idea). They had better things to do. Like, for example, world war 2.
#### [Hypodermic needle](Definitions/theories/Hypodermic%20needle.md) Idea Starts To Crack
If you’re in Communication Science, you’ve probably heard of the War of the Worlds radio show. A recap: in 1938 there was this radio radio play (Dutch: hoorspel) in which the radio announced there was an alien invasion. There were government officials, fake eye witnesses, and news reporters all telling this story. It was all fake, but 16 million people listened to it, and 1 million people completely lost their shit. They evacuated with their kids and pets, they called their neighbours to to the same, like they actually believed there was an alien invasion. 

However, there were 15 million people that remained calm. With the [Hypodermic needle](Definitions/theories/Hypodermic%20needle.md) perspective, that’s just something you can’t explain. What the flip! To figure out why that was, 135 people were interviewed by some researcher named Cantril. He, for example, found out that religious people were more likely to panic, just like people who had tuned in after receiving a call from a loved one. 

More broadly speaking: in the 1930s and 1940s there was already research done that supported the conditional media effects idea. In 1948 Bernard Berelsen wrote: “Some kinds of communication, on some kinds of issues, brought to the attention of some kinds of people, under certain kinds of conditions, have some kinds of effects” (p. 37). 

A little later we had Klapper in 1960, who explained this with his idea of selective exposure. Still, this is an important idea. He argued that people also have a tendency toward “*selective perception, selective interpretation*, and *selective retention*” (p. 37, emphasis added).
