This chapter is basically a review of children and children's media throughout history. The first book about raising children was Rousseau’s in 1762. That’s the starting point of this chapter.
### Before 1762: Children as Miniature Adults
Before this time there was no specific media for children because they were literally seen as small adults. When (if) children could read, they read the same material as adults did. Like they were treated exactly the same as adults and they saw the same gross and horrible things. For example: “children would regularly accompany their parents to the market square to attend public beheadings and physical punishments.” (p. 12)
### The Vulnerable Child
Rousseau and Locke wrote that children maybe deserved some protection. And so, newspapers disappeared from the classrooms, fairy tales were scrubbed of explicit material, and even the bible in schools was partially censored.

The idea that children are a clean slate (tabula rasa, Locke) became popular. So money, sex, death, etc. was not discussed with them. Parents stopped kissing each other in front of their kids and were also hesitant to express love to the children (in an effort to keep them pure). However, this was only really a thing for the wealthy because everyone else died a very young age. All the upbringing was, was “teaching them to cope with pain and \[preparing\] them for an early death.” (p. 13)

In the 1900s, normal people got rights, so then this also became a thing for the rest of the children. Punishments became less harsh and stuff as well.
### The Miniature Adult Returns
It’s the 1960s and 1970s. There’s hippies and other youth-driven cultrural emancipation groups. There’s commercial TV. Maybe it’s bad to present kids with this sanitised worldview and maybe we should talk about the real world with them, is what many thought again.
#### Criticisms Of–And Explanations For–The Miniature Adult Idea
Communication scholars (e.g., Postman, Elkind, Meyrowitz) came in and talked about how the difference between adulthood and childhood was fading - and thereby childhood itself was eroding. They argued that the TV was the cause of this. Because  books and  stuff are only accesible to those that read  (i.e, aduts)  there is this real seperation of who can view that media. With tv, anyone could watch it. This lead to the “homogenization of children and aduts.” Critics thought this put pressure on children.

The “drip drip” effect idea is the idea that media can change us - or the social order - very slowly. An example of how this works is Gerbner’s cultivation theory that lead to the “mainstreaming” of culture (i.e., decreasing the cultural differences between social groups).

There were also changes in family communication. Parents didn’t want to be authority figures anymore, but rather friends. Kids were seen as autonomous people, yet they still needed a carefree childhood.

**Margaret Mead**, anthropologist, correctly predicted how parent-child relationships would change after the 1960s. She wrote about **three different types of cultures: post-figurative, co-figurative and pre-figurative**. In the first kind (in the west until 1950s), parents are the role model. “Children are expected to follow in the footsteps of their parents and grandparents” (p. 19). When there is rapid technological change, there will be a co-figurative culture because the parents did not experience the technological change when they were young, so they can no longer be role models to their kids. Here, adults and children orient themselves mostly to their peers. According to Mead, this is a temporary stage because a pre-figurative culture will follow in which the youth are the role model. This is the culture we live in now.

**Commercialism As a Cause.** They go on to write about how making TV (and advertisements) for children might have also lead to a cultural change wherein we take young people more seriously. 

### Are Children Different Than They Used To Be?
The short answer: yes. In different ways:

1. Puberty happens earlier. Probably because we have different diets now. They studies whether going to the cinema could predict earlier puberty, but they found no effect.
2. Our IQ’s are higher. Probably also because we have better nutrition now. But that’s definitely not the only cause. Also think about environmental factors (e.g., kids growing up in households with less kids). Interestingly, watching TV might have contributed to this! When you watch tv, you use your brain, hence higher (fluid) IQ.
3. Self-awareness and Self-esteem. Probably because we have different social norms (e.g., selfie culture). Also: high self esteem and self-awareness leads to narcissism!! So the current generation is more narcissistic.
4. Psychological problems (e.g., ADHD, anxiety, depression). There is a small (but significant) relationship between media use and ADHD and anxiety. However, the increases are most probably because the diagnostic criteria have broadened.
