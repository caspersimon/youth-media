This is really just a short paper (930 words) about how little there is actually known about how screen time relates to the well-being of children and young people (CYP). Some points they make are:

1. “Screen time” is a useless term. Screen time can refer to being on social media, gaming, or watching tv. All these different uses of screen time might have different effects. For example, other research found that “passive screen time” (i.e., watching tv) was related with worse physical health but “active screen time” (i.e., gaming) was not.
2. Any other associations are not necessarily causal and probably have confounding variables. More screen time is positively related to higher obese rates, but also with more snacking. So: snack less. Also, more screen time might also replace other activities (like sports) so that might also be the real issue.
3. When parents have less screen time, kids will follow.

Worth it to read this article because I feel like they might ask for details I didn’t cover here.
