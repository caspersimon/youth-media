ABSTRACT KEYWORDS 

  

Mental health; flm; content analysis; stigma; identity; intersectionality

  

Popular flm contains an abundance of information pertaining to identity and stigma attributions popularly linked with those experien­cing mental health concerns. However, this domain remains under- examined with regard to health identity representations, notably as they intersect with other social identities. Thirty years of the most popular flms emphasizing mental health were content analyzed for the purpose of obtaining a contemporary assessment of the stigmatiz­ing potential of representation patterns, notably, extending beyond popularly established associations of mental illness with danger. Distortions were observed disproportionately connecting those experiencing mental illness with stigmatizing attributes in myriad ways, including risky health behaviors (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, eating issues), various forms of aggression (e.g., physical, verbal, sexual), and reactions to adversity (e.g., crying, attempting self- harm, and having struggles diminished by others). Additionally, evi­dence suggests a relative dearth of displaying the experiences of non- culturally dominant social identities and their intersections with men­tal health identity. Prior research has indicated that that mediated portrayals of those experiencing mental illness can infuence self- perceptions and social inclinations pertaining to this health identity. Findings are discussed in terms of these potential outcomes.

  

Mental illness (MI) is a public health phenomenon that has an impact on virtually every living person in the United States, directly or indirectly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2018), more than 50% of all American adults will experience a mental health condition during their lifetime. Moreover, one in four adults will develop some form of MI each year (Duckworth, 2013). Despite the ubiquity of these health conditions, public perception about them remains clouded by social stigma and misinfor­mation due, in part, to how these illnesses are represented in the media. Specifcally, health researchers examining MI depictions within mass media have observed that those indivi­duals with MI are routinely stigmatized as violent, dangerous, and erratic (Wahl, 2003). Research has observed that such cultural MI derogation can infuence self-stigma for those managing these conditions and reduce their perceived efcacy for self-care (Corrigan & Watson, 2002). Additionally, exposure to these themes has also been observed to be

negatively associated with interaction inclinations oriented toward those managing MI (Quintero Johnson & Riles, 2018).

  

Pertaining to MI depictions, one content area much in need of a contemporary examina­tion is modern popular flm. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, flm consumption has been one of the most notable ways that Americans expose themselves to mass messages. However, research regarding MI representations has predominantly been oriented toward news coverage (e.g., Wahl, 2003). Since the mid-1980s, American flm has been a multi- billion-dollar industry, grossing more than 10 USD billion dollars in box ofce sales annually throughout the 2010s (Box Ofce Mojo, 2020). As such, popular content decisions about how to depict MI within this medium have the capacity for far-reaching audience infuence. At present, most research that has concertedly examined MI representations in flm has often focused on the more stereotypical and vivid depictions of MI in particular messages, such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Psycho (e.g., Anderson, 2003). Relatively few studies have explored the broader landscape of MI depictions in flm (cf., Wahl, 1992), however, health and media researchers have many insights to gain by such an endeavor.

  

In addition to focusing on the degree to which those with MI are portrayed as unpredict­able and aggressive – as has traditionally been conducted – health media research would further beneft from a detailed examination of the conditions under which additional distortions may exist. Considering the intersectionality – described by Crenshaw (1991) as the various overlapping identities to which people ascribe, or to which people have ascribed upon them – of a MI health identity with other social identities may aford opportunities to theorize about stereotypical MI demographic associations. Moreover, beyond aggression, additional stigmatizing character attributes (e.g., adversity management styles, broader health risk orientations, etc) may be routinely connected to those with mental health concerns. In this vein, there are several important themes of intersectional identity and character attribute associations that remain under-explored. First, it is necessary to determine if characters’ association with MI is related to social demographic and identity patterns (Bastién, 2016; Junior, 2015). Specifcally, it would be informative to determine if MI is linked with specifc patterns of race, sexuality, or religiosity. Additionally, it is important to determine if the characterization of having a MI is connected with concrete stigmatizing behaviors that are not necessarily associated with physical danger to others. Specifcally, we explore if managing MI is distortedly linked with various stigmatized health behaviors (e.g., drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, doing drugs, unhealthy eating tendencies). Relatedly, researchers con­cerned with health representations would beneft from an examination of whether popular flm disproportionately associates MI with muted success in dealing with pressures in life, including crying, attempting suicide, and having one’s struggles minimized by others. Guided by the conceptual frameworks of intersectionality and stigma theory (e.g., Smith, 2007), these themes are explored via a content analysis of popular flm with an emphasis on mental disorder over a recent thirty-year period (i.e., 1986–2015). Given the reach of these messages and the potential for negative outcomes related to unwarranted social stigma and self-identity turbulence, such an analysis is vital.

  

## Film and Perceptions of Mental Illness

  

The mediated representation of health issues has been repeatedly observed to infuence the salience of media consumers’ specifc health concerns (e.g., Riles et al., 2015). Theoretical 

  

models of mediated accessibility (priming, Roskos-Ewoldsen et al., 2008; mental models and chronic accessibility; Mastro et al., 2007) generally suggest that exposure to a mediated stimulus can inform individuals’ subsequent judgments and behaviors. This phenomenon has been investigated with regard to a number of mediated representations of social groups and identities, including racial (e.g., Dixon, 2006) and sexual minorities (e.g., Miller & Lewallen, 2015), and those managing MI (Quintero Johnson & Riles, 2018). Such infuences on social and self-judgments are especially likely when consumers are routinely exposed to popular message themes and engage in relatively less systematic processing of the media content (Bradley, 2007), a common element of entertainment media exposure.

  

Prior research has routinely observed that people with MI are schematically associated in media with violence and as culturally deviant in society (Klin & Lemish, 2008) . According to stigma theory (Smith, 2007), the association of a particular social identity with various physical or social threats and abnormalities is a potent means through which that identity can be disqualifed from social acceptance (Gofman, 1963). As such, in addition to the conceptual incorporation of intersectionality precepts for examining identity overlap pat­terns, this research employs stigma theory to examine patterns related to specifc character­istics with which those experiencing MI are associated. Smith (2007) defnes stigma as “a simplifed, standardized image of the disgrace of certain people that is held in common by a community at large” (p. 464). Wahl (1992) observed three stigmatizing traits that are stereotypically used to characterize MI: inadequacy, unlikability, and danger. Each of these characteristics represent a conceivably socially disqualifying attribute that could be expected to enhance a consumer’s perceived social stigma about MI (Gofman, 1963). Mental representations, such as these, are routinely employed during the formation of social attitudes and behavioral inclinations regarding others (D. Mastro & Kopacz, 2006).

  

Research that has focused on representations of those with MI has frequently emphasized newspaper coverage (e.g., Gwarjanski & Parrott, 2018; Wahl, 2003). For example, Wahl (2003) found that negative stories, focused on danger and peril, greatly outnumbered positive ones, focused on recovery or accomplishment. In more recent research of MI coverage in the news, Gwarjanski and Parrott (2018) found that news media routinely connect MI, like schizophrenia, with stigma-inducing incidents of violent behavior and criminal activity. Such patterns echo the observations of prior researchers (Coverdale et al., 2002) in New Zealand who similarly found that negative print stories were dominant and links to danger and criminality were commonplace. These accounts of news coverage of MI are useful and informative. However, it would behoove health and media researchers to increasingly examine the state of portrayals as they relate to media that are routinely processed relatively less systematically.

  

Entertainment media has been observed as being processed, in general, with less sys­tematic and central processing than news media (Petty & Caccioppo, 1984). As a result, a number of health researchers have argued that depictions of MI in entertainment media more robustly shape public perception of MI than depictions found in the news (e.g., Pirkis et al., 2005). Therefore, entertainment media – notably, flm content – warrants increased examination with regard to better understanding prevailing stigmatization pertaining to those with MI. Studies examining the infuence of particular flm portrayals of MI (e.g., Donnie Darko, Perciful & Meyer, 2017), have observed that exposure can negatively infuence respondents’ opinions of those with MI. In a study examining potential infuences of flm and television exposure more broadly, Quintero Johnson and Riles (2018) observed

that participants who were asked to describe media characters associated with MI listed a total of 131 unique characters; the most commonly cited characters came from flm (e.g., A Beautiful Mind, Rain Man, I Am Sam). This exposure was observed to be associated with stereotypical and stigmatizing perceptions of MI which, ultimately, resulted in diminished comfort at the prospect of social interaction with someone known to have MI. Taken together, flm would appear to be a vital medium in which to examine mass MI representations.

  

## Attributes of Mental Illness

  

Academic scholarship has not, as yet, given due emphasis to the typical identities shown in media as intersecting with portrayals of MI; however, a few popular press articles have taken up this call. In 2015, a writer for Bitch Media, an alternative feminist outlet, wrote about the lack of portrayals of African American women with mental health issues (Junior, 2015). “Women of color – specifcally African American women – are not aforded the same type of humanity onscreen,” wrote Junior (2015), adding that this lack of representation and general stereotypes about assertive Black women lead many to think of MI in women as a Caucasian phenomenon. If such distortions are found to exist, they may be further isolating people of diverse identities who identify as managing MI. In a similar piece for Splinter, Angelica Jade Bastién (2016) asked, “Why don’t women of color get to be mentally ill on TV?” Although both authors cite a few examples of women of color dealing with MI on television (e.g., Dr. Miranda Bailey on Grey’s Anatomy), their focus is on the lack of representation certain demographics (including those based in ethnicity, sex, or sexuality) have in terms of who is shown as being at risk for and/or living with MI. Other social identity features, like religiosity, similarly may be linked with mental health concerns in unknown ways. Though prior research suggests that the vast majority (more than 80%) of those diagnosed with persistent mental illness will use religious beliefs as a means of coping with daily challenges (Tepper et al., 2001), no study has systematically examined how popular media display this intersectional identity link. As such, the current research examined not only the overall prevalence of MI depictions in flm, but also the demographic and identity-based breakdowns of MI representations with the following research question: 

  

RQ1: For individuals depicted as having a mental health condition, what are the most commonly depicted demographic and social identities, such as a) races/ethnicities, b) genders, c) ages, d) sexual orientations, and e) religious involvement?

  

As aforementioned, a paucity of research has focused on flm’s portrayal of MI, relative to that examining news content. On television, individuals portrayed as having MI have historically been depicted as unlikable, unemployable, and aggressively violent (e.g., Signorielli, 1989). In fact, characters with MI were 10 times more likely than those without MI to be represented as violent and criminal (Diefenbach & West, 2007), all while available evidence suggests that those managing MI engage in aggression, notably toward strangers, at a rate of about half of those in the broader community (Stuart, 2006). Therefore, while it is evident that MI has a longstanding history of being associated with violence, aggression, and danger, it is worth exploring the extent to which this trend persists. Moreover, it is necessary to determine whether the media is depicting those with MI as being generally 

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/89c93bcdc5785e79.jpg)

  

aggressive, or as engaging in specifc forms of aggression (i.e., physical, verbal, sexual), a distinction that is not commonly made. Thus, we ofer the following research question: 

  

RQ2: With what frequency are characters depicted as having a mental health condition shown exhibiting a) physical, b) verbal, and c) sexual aggression?

  

In addition to being routinely represented as perpetrators of violence, those with a MI are often associated with other socially disqualifying attributes, such as having a negative impact on society (Diefenbach & West, 2007). Though violence and aggres­sion are most popularly examined as schematic attributes for the representation of MI, additional stigmatizing qualities which warrant increased examination pertain to the depicted potential of those with MI to take care of themselves and manage life’s challenges. Some research suggests that individuals with MI are routinely depicted in ways that promote their childlikeness with relatively few televised depictions of MI wherein characters were successful in managing their symptoms without intervention (Henderson, 2018). One potential outcome of exposure to these depictions would be the heightening of perceptions of self-stigma for those managing these conditions, reducing their own perceived efcacy for self-care (Corrigan & Watson, 2002). Such depictions could have massive ramifcations with regard to how people managing MI are perceived, or perceive themselves, to be able to successfully live an independent life. As such, we pose the following research questions: 

  

RQ3: With what frequency are characters depicted as having a mental health condition shown exhibiting relatively risky health behaviors, such as a) using drugs, b) using alcohol, c) smoking cigarettes, d) engaging in extreme binging, or e) undereating?

  

RQ4: With what frequency are characters depicted as having a mental health condition shown to be experiencing limited success when managing adversity via acts, such as a) crying, b) engaging in suicide attempts, or c) having others diminish their struggles?

  

Finally, the mediated impact of various MI identity and stigma associations will be most pronounced if those characteristics are disproportionately and distortedly associated with those managing MI compared to those not labeled in this manner. Notably, if characters in flm with MI are not widely represented, systematic distortions could precipitate a limited and distorted repertoire of accessible exemplars of MI. As such, we pose the following research question: 

  

RQ5: Do individuals depicted as having MI difer from those who are not depicted as having MI in terms of a) demographic and social identities, b) exhibition of aggression, c) engage­ment in risky health behaviors, or d) reactions to adversity?

  

## Method

  

This project was developed with the goal of assessing prominent characterizations of individuals who are explicitly associated with mental health concerns in popular flm.

### Sample

  

Our sample consisted of top-grossing flms from the thirty-year period in which flm became a multi-billion-dollar industry (Box Ofce Mojo, 2020), wherein an emphasis was placed on a main or supporting character who was managing MI. We began our sampling by producing a list of mental disorder types that were noted to be the most prevalent in the United States. Real-world prevalence data found anxiety (e.g., generalized anxiety, obses­sive-compulsive, and post-traumatic stress), mood (e.g., bipolar, and major depressive), personality (e.g., antisocial personality, and paranoid personality), and impulse-control /behavioral (e.g., restrictive/binge eating, and intermittent explosive) disorders to be the most prevalent (Demyttenaere et al., 2004; Kessler et al., 2005, 2012; Sansone & Sansone, 2011). Though not as prevalent in the real-world, schizophrenia and dissociative identity disorder have been routinely observed to receive distorted representation – in terms of amount and characterization – in entertainment media (Brand et al., 2016; Ritterfeld & Jin, 2006). Thus, our fnal list included 13 specifc conditions and can be found in Table 1. Once this list was produced, we began a search for flm content with characters associated with these conditions.

  

After an extensive search, the most comprehensively exhaustive source of flm associations with MI was found to be an online wiki list (Wikipedia, 2017) of several dozen disorders as well as their relation to several hundred flms. This list provided the most substantial scope of content, explicitly indicating their association (both main and supporting characters) with specifc MIs. Moreover, it was constructed by way of consulting several academic texts (e.g., Gabbard & Gabbard, 1999; Robinson, 2003; Wahl, 1997; Wedding et al., 2005) among additional online sources. Finally, it allowed us to generate an initial population of content representative of a public, evidence- supported, collaborative perspective on MI which, given its global popularity (Lewoniewski et al., 2017), could be expected to be used by consumers looking for flm representations of particular MIs. Though the viability of sources like Wikipedia for supporting academic arguments has long been open to debate, we would argue that such a compendium ofers afordances as an initial step in the process of sampling from a wide range of content in which an association with specifc themes is a necessity. In lieu of an existing registry of psychologist-sanctioned flm portrayals of mental illness,

we are able to assess the qualities of flm content that the average moviegoer would have been led to believe, via online summaries and promotional materials, contains portrayals of MI. Nevertheless, flms on this initial list were further scrutinized for their emphasis of characters with MI before inclusion in the fnal sample, including mention of specifc symptoms, diagnoses, and informal references to disordered mental state.

  

All flms associated with our list of disorders were assessed on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB, 2017) and each flm’s Wikipedia page for mentions of MI within the flm summaries and synopses. This was done to reafrm that disorders were present and emphasized. For those flms which remained, fve-year intervals (i.e., from “1986–1990” to “2011–2015”) were constructed and the ten flms with the highest box ofce ticket sales (Box Ofce Mojo, 2017) during each period were selected for the fnal sample. In so doing, our analyses focused on those flms which emphasized MI but also had the greatest reach and potential for audience infuences. This procedure provided us with 60 of the most popular flms for examination over this 30-year time period (see online supplementary materials available at https://osf.io/ kmtp4). DVDs of these flms were purchased for analysis by three independent coders.

  

### Coding Procedure

  

The unit of analysis for this project was the character. Six flms, totaling 70 unique characters (a number of unique units sufcient for conducting reliability analysis; e.g., D. E. Mastro & Behm-Morawitz, 2005), were randomly chosen for the purposes of conducting intercoder reliability. Disagreements were discussed and resolved by three independent coders, unaware of the aims of the study but extensively trained on the codebook. All other flms were coded independently. All coded variables (discussed below) except drug use behaviors met or exceeded Krippendorf’s (2004) suggested alpha minimum threshold of α ≥ .67.

  

### Variables

  

#### Character Race/Ethnicity

  

Researchers coded for the presence of White, Black, Latinx, Asian/Asian-American, Middle- Eastern, Indian/Indian-American, and other/multiracial characters. Racial/ethnic identity (a=0.93)was inferred via the use of indicators such as last name, accents, and visual portrayal.

  

#### Character Gender

  

Analysts coded for the presence of female, male, and gender nonconforming characters. Gender (α = 0.98) was reliably inferred via manifest characteristics (e.g., appearance, voice) as well as the characters’ names.

  

### Character Age

  

Age (α = 0.88) was assessed via physical attributes of characters as well as contextual features (e.g., personality, activities, school enrollment, etc.). Characters were classifed as youth (age 17 and below), young adult (18–30), adult (31–64), or elderly (65 and above).

  

### Character Sexual Orientation

  

Sexuality (α = 1.00) was assessed via the stated romantic preferences or actions of the character. Characters were classifed as heterosexual and non-heterosexual. Although we 

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/59c210cc105fa5e2.jpg)

  

recognize that there is clearly a greater variation to sexuality, the lack of sexual diversity in the content prompted us toward a more general categorization scheme.

  

### Character Religiosity

  

Religiosity (α = 0.75) was assessed via the stated and performed religious activities and dress of characters. With the abundance of potential religious denominations possible, we opted to assess the degree to which characters espoused spiritual activities related to belief in a deity or set of deities. Characters were classifed as no religious indicators, subtle religious indicators (e.g., performing the Catholic cross with one’s hands before a meal), or strong religious indicators (e.g., routinely discussing the role of religion in one’s life).

  

### Aggression

  

Aggression was assessed via the actions of characters. Physical aggression (a=0.75)involved some sort of tactile exhibition of hostility. Verbal aggression (α = 0.67) included threats, insults, hostile yelling. Sexual aggression (α = 0.74) consisted of violence accom­panying both sexual and firtatious behaviors.

  

### Risky Health Behaviors

  

These tendencies included consumption of substances associated with health risks (i.e., cigarettes [α=1.00], alcohol [a=0.80], drugs), as well as issues with the healthy manage­ment of the quantity of food intake (i.e., restrictive [a=1.00] or binge a=1.00] eating). Drug intake was a variable that did not reach acceptable reliability levels and is, therefore, not included in subsequent analyses.

  

### Reactions to Adversity

  

Experiences handling adversity in life was assessed via examining what characters did while undergoing challenging circumstances (i.e., crying  [a=0.88] or attempting suicide [α = 0.75]), as well as how other characters reacted to a given person’s troubles (i.e., having one’s struggles diminished[a=1.00]).

  

## Results

  

Analyses were conducted to examine patterns regarding the depiction of characters with MI compared to characters not identifed as such. Results from our frst four research ques­tions, concerning raw frequencies of characters identifed as having a mental health condi­tion, are depicted in Table 1. Of all 1,127 characters examined in this analysis of popular flm over three decades, 5% (n=58)were associated with an explicit reference to a mental health condition. Of those characters, antisocial personality disorder was revealed to be the most prevalent condition, while panic disorder and social phobia were the least prevalent of the conditions that appeared. Instances of restrictive eating disorders, intermittent explosive disorder, and paranoid personality disorder were not observed in any flms. With regard to RQ1, concerning frequencies of social identity and demographic characteristics, characters who were White (97% of characters with MI; RQ1a), male (79%; RQ1b), adult-aged (88%; RQ1c), heterosexual (94%; RQ1d), and who did not display religious indicators (72%; RQ1e) were observed to have the greatest raw association with mental illness. These data are all presented in Table 2.

With regard to RQ2 concerning proportion of characters with a MI associated with aggression, physical aggression (70%; RQ2a) was the most prevalent, followed by verbal aggression (55%; RQ2b), and fnally sexual aggression (12%; RQ2c). With regard to RQ3 concerning frequency of engaging in risky health behaviors, intercoder reliability for drug intake (RQ3a) did not reach a usable threshold. Nevertheless, alcohol consumption (33%; RQ3b) was the most prevalent health risk behavior, followed by smoking cigarettes (24%; RQ3c), binge eating (3%; RQ3d), and fnally restrictive eating (3%; RQ3e). With regard to RQ4 concerning frequency of distressed adversity experiences, crying (48%; RQ4a) was the most prevalent, followed by having one’s struggles diminished (10%; RQ4c), and fnally attempting suicide (5%; RQ4b). These data are all presented in Table 3.

  

Our next endeavor was to assess whether the aforementioned attributes were dispropor­tionately associated with characters experiencing MI, relative to those who were not identifed as such. This examination, pertaining to RQ5, was conducted via chi-squared analysis, and is presented in Tables 2 and 3. Where cell counts were low, Fisher’s exact test was utilized. With regard to RQ5a, compared to those who were not identifed as having MI, the representation of those with MI adhered to probabilistic expectations in terms of race/ ethnicity, age, and sexuality. However, with regard to gender, males were observed to be disproportionately overrepresented as having a MI, while females were underrepresented. With regard to religiosity, those with MI were overrepresented as being religious (both subtle and strong indicators) compared to those who did not have MI. These data are presented in Table 3.

Due to low cell counts, some analyses are reported as a Fisher’s exact test. This analytical procedure does not yield a statistic (only a p-value) and is denoted in the table as “F”.

  

With regard to RQ5b, compared to those who were not identifed as having MI, those with MI were distortedly overrepresented as physically, verbally, sexually aggressive. With regard to RQ5c, compared to those who were not identifed as having MI, those with MI were distortedly overrepresented as drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, as well as enga­ging in extreme binging and undereating. With regard to RQ5d, compared to those who were not identifed as having MI, those with MI were overrepresented as crying, attempting suicide, and having their troubles diminished. These data are all presented in Table 3.

  

## Discussion

  

The current study contributes to health and media scholarship by articulating the recent landscape of popular mental health representations in three recent decades of flm. This task was conceptually undertaken with consideration of the schematic associations popular flm promotes in terms of intersectionality of social and health identities and the stigmatization of characters with MI. In all, our data suggest a propensity to both represent characters managing MI as aggressive and as less able to engage in healthy-living and adversity management, both of which could be considered to discredit these individuals from full social acceptance (Gofman, 1963).

  

In general, even in these flms that were selected due to an emphasis of characters with MI, the presence of individuals with these health conditions would appear to be drastically underrepresented. Evidence suggests that approximately 25% of adults will experience MI in a given year (Duckworth, 2013), however, observations indicate that 5% of flm char­acters are associated with this health identity. Naturally, our method of identifying char­acters with MI (i.e., relying on explicit references) may have underestimated the number of characters who content creators might have been implying were managing MI. Nevertheless, pronounced representation of characters with MI would appear relatively muted. Though evidence suggests anxiety and mood disorders are the most prevalent in the United States population (Kessler et al., 2012; Sansone & Sansone, 2011), a personality disorder was observed to be the most common in these popular flms. OCD, the most

prevalent anxiety disorder observed, was revealed to be fourth in terms of overall flm prevalence rankings. These patterns may suggest the utility of certain MIs over others in the development of mass appeal narratives. Antisocial personality disorder, specifcally, may be viewed by writers and directors as more conducive to the mainstream storytelling and characterization of individuals explicitly experiencing MI in flm.

  

At the same time, there is a near-complete invisibility of other illnesses, such as inter­mittent explosive disorder and social phobias. As much as stereotypical portrayals are an issue, so too is the screen erasure of various widespread MI, in that it might make individuals with those mental health conditions feel alone and isolated. Symbolic annihila­tion (Gerbner & Gross, 1976) is a term to describe the trend of omitting certain people and their experiences from the media landscape. When certain social identity intersections are emphasized and others are neglected, such message choices can have repercussions for the self-identity and self-esteem of those omitted. Thus, popular flm could beneft from diversifying the types of MI that are chosen for storytelling. Given that characters with MI currently receive scant attention, in general, major eforts are necessary in order to achieve accuracy in mental health representativeness.

  

Characters with MI were predominantly members of hegemonic-majority groups, which could arguably be quite problematic. If a flm consumer were to assume any degree of accuracy in popular representation, they might conclude that the typical picture of someone with MI is that of a White, adult, heterosexual male. Examples of such char­acters in the sample include Bob Wiley in What About Bob?, Martin Burney in Sleeping with the Enemy, and Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July. The dearth of exemplars of this particular intersectional identity in the public consciousness may play role in the divergent race-based afective responses to MI (Anglin et al., 2006). Still, many of the social identities commonly linked with MI in flm were not overrepresented in terms of their statistical link to MI. Indeed, 97% of characters with MI were White, 88% adult, and 94% were heterosexual, yet these frequencies were not associated with statistical over­representation. Moreover, the majority of those with MI had no religious indicators (72%), yet this was associated with an underrepresentation of those identities as having MI. Thus, in addition to patterns of disproportionate MI attribute associations, these patterns are also indicative of the bias toward potentially over representing majority identities on-screen, in general.

  

Further exploring demographic themes, women were observed to be signifcantly under­represented as having MI with raw frequencies more than ffty percentage points below that of males. According to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 21.7% of adult women in the U.S. manage MI, compared to 14.5% for men (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016). Thus, though the aims of the current study were to conduct inter-group identity comparisons, we see evidence of a rather stark inter- reality distortion. One potential explanation for this underrepresentation could lie in the types of MI that appeared frequently in the data. The overrepresentation of aggression in the sample may have led to over-casting of males in order to supplement the plot, as severity of violence committed by females has been shown to be perceived signifcantly lower than that by men (Savage et al., 2017). Indeed, evidence suggests that relative to males, female characters with MI are associated more with sympathetic portrayals (Quintero Johnson & Miller, 2016), which may not adhere to the spectacle of high-grossing flm portrayals. In our sample, females with MI often sufered from personality disorders (e.g., Tifany Maxwell in

Silver Linings Playbook, Susanna Kaysen and Lisa Rowe in Girl, Interrupted, Betty Sizemore in Nurse Betty), whereas men were featured with a broader range of disorders, including those more stereotypically related to aggressive behaviors.

  

Furthermore, data indicates that people with MI are disproportionately linked with stigmatized lifestyle choices (e.g., drinking, smoking, disordered eating). If the image continues to be perpetuated that people with MI are wholly unable to take care of themselves in terms of diet and broader health, broader systemic or biological causes of struggles in these domains may be deemphasized. Prior research has repeatedly demon­strated that when personal causes for issues related to well-being are emphasized over systemic causes, perceptions of the severity of plight are diminished and perceptions of culpability are oriented toward those in disadvantaged situations (e.g., Iyengar, 1990). Indeed, such actions were modeled in our data wherein having one’s struggles diminished was revealed to be an outcome disproportionately oriented toward those experiencing MI.

  

The data revealed physical, verbal, and sexual aggression to be disproportionately and distortedly the province of those with MI, supporting the long-established schematic associations of MI with stigma via danger and threat attributions (e.g., Diefenbach & West, 2007; Link & Cullen, 1986; Sief, 2003). These depictions have been shown to produce antisocial and prejudicial responses among media consumers (e.g., Riles, 2020), yet they remain rampant. Pertaining to harm to the self, only fve instances of attempted suicide were contained within the sample, yet the majority of them were disproportionately oriented toward characters with MI. For example, Daisy Randone, who has OCD, commits suicide in Girl, Interrupted, after being verbally harassed by another character, who herself is sociopathic. Another example occurs in Room, when trauma victim Joy Newsome attempts suicide after a difcult confrontation with a reporter. Such an association has problematic implications with regard to potential imitation among those seeking remedies to major adversity, who also identify as managing MI. On the other hand, when characters are shown positively coping with a mental health crisis by means of overcoming a suicide attempt, it can result in increased feelings of life satisfaction, especially for those higher in suicidal ideation (Till et al., 2015). It would behoove flm producers to be more conscientious about how they associate social identities with such dire life choices given the potential for real- world ramifcations.

  

The present investigation is not without limitations. Our study was also limited in its ability to designate characters as having MI beyond what was provided in flm summaries and synopses. As a result of our lack of diagnostic expertise, we felt it imprudent to identify MI ourselves and, therefore, may have missed some instances of MI that were subtler or not emphasized during the initial content selection procedure. The typical flm consumer, however, is also not diagnostically trained and, therefore, would also not be anticipated to identify every instance of MI. As such, we feel that our procedure is still representative of broader flm use experiences in which a desire to see a particular MI in flm would involve an online summary search that would return the relatively more popular content.

  

This content analysis serves as a foundation for future health research to examine the infuences of the most prominent health representation distortions present in contemporary media. Aside from flm, future research should also examine the nature of character distortions related to MI on television and online video services (e.g., YouTube, Tik Tok). Furthermore, future researchers may consider conducting a time series analysis, observing changes in our various MI character attributes in flm throughout time. These examinations

were beyond the scope and space of the current piece, however, ANOVA results revealed that the prevalence of MI did not signifcantly difer between our six time periods (F [1, 5]=1.22,p=.30). A comprehensive examination of popular MI depictions from the earliest eras of flm until the present would provide the requisite number of data points for a time series analysis and be of great scholarly utility.

  

Via examining the identity-based and stigmatizing tropes associated with mental health, health and media researchers will be better positioned to articulate strategies for remediat­ing some of the more problematic content trends characterizing the vast population of individuals who will experience a mental health concern in their lives. Such stigmatizing health tropes and presentation strategies are ubiquitous, in part, because they make reference to ideas already entrenched within a given society that may go unnoticed (Tewksbury & Scheufele, 2019). With nearly half of adults experiencing some form of MI in their lifetime (CDC, 2018), it is important that these conditions be increasingly destig­matized so that those experiencing MI will feel greater comfort seeking out help or sharing their experiences with others.
