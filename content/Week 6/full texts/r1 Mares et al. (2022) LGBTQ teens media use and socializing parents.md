### ABSTRACT

  

Recent theorizing posits that parents and their children infu­ence each other, and that media use is a locus of such mutual infuence. Two surveys of LGBTQ 18- and 19-year-olds (N=276; N = 369, the latter a replication) tested hypotheses that LGBTQ teens use media to socialize their parents about their sexual and gender identities, and that these uses elicit parental responses which have implications for the teen. In both studies, teens reported co-viewing and mediating their parents’ exposure to LGBTQ content (i.e., encouraging positive exposure, discoura­ging negative exposure, critiquing/explicating depictions) and indicated that such moments sometimes elicited conversations about their own sexual or gender identities. In both studies, their perceptions of their parents’ receptivity to these interac­tions varied widely. In both studies, teens’ LGBTQ-media-related behavior and perceptions of parental receptivity were positively associated with perceptions that their parents supported their LGBTQ identity. Perceived receptivity (in Study 1) and perceived support for the teens’ LGBTQ identities (in Study 2) were asso­ciated with teens’ self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Overall, despite some inconsistencies between the two studies and the limitations of cross-sectional data, the fndings are consistent with mutual infuence.

  

Although models of child socialization have long theorized that children and parents infuence each other (e.g., Bell & Harper, 1977), relatively little research has examined how infuence may fow back and forth in the context of family media use, or the consequences of such interactions. The current project examines whether and how lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) teens use media messages to shape their parents’ understand­ing of their LGBTQ identities, how they perceive their parents’ responses, and the possible implications for the teens’ mental health.

  

Consider the dynamic in which LGBTQ teens disclose their sexual or gender identities to their parents and work to gain parental acceptance: The teen is generally (though not always) more expert than the parent on a topic

that has emotional implications for both, within a relationship where authority tends to reside with the parent but both partners have the power to support or hurt the other. In such contexts, media depictions of LGBTQ experiences can be a source of insight and empathy on the one hand, or stereotypes and hostility on the other.

  

We envisioned a dynamic in which teens may try to infuence their parents’ exposure to LGBTQ characters and storylines (encouraging or discouraging viewing of certain LGBTQ depictions, critiquing or explaining depictions) and even use such interactions to open conversations about their sexual or gender identities. LGBTQ-media-related behaviors, together with teens’ evaluations of their parents’ receptivity (e.g., willingness to watch, comments of interest or disgust, changing the channel) may shape teens’ evaluations of the extent to which their parents support their identities, with implications for teens’ self- esteem and depressive symptoms.

  

## Parent-Child Mutual Infuence

  

In a call to action for media scholars, Van Den Bulck, Custers, and Nelissen (2016) argued that researchers should study not only how parents and media afect children, but also how children infuence parents. They pointed readers to a seminal piece by Bell (1968) who noted that in parent-child interactions, efects fow back and forth in event sequences (e.g., a child misbehaves, the parent scolds, the child cries). Relatedly, Samerof and Chandler (1975) argued that child characteristics are shaped by caregivers, but also shape the practices and experiences of those caregivers.

  

Building on this early work, Kuczynski and Parkin (2009) developed their social relational theory, proposing that parents and children infuence each other via moments when their working models of the world come into confict. The power of such moments to change one or both members of the dyad stems from the fact that the parent-child relationship is, at least normatively, a life- long commitment. Although the parent often has more authority, neither party would readily abandon the other, both are vulnerable and powerful with regard to each other. The opinions, actions, and desires of one may infuence the other, though the extent of this infuence varies with the sub­jectivity of the domain and the child’s age and expertise.

  

Social relational theory has been used to examine mutual infuence in various contexts, including “picky eating” as an expression of child agency (Walton, Kuczynski, Haycraft, Breen, & Haines, 2017), dynamics of parent- child confict (Kuczynski & Kochanska, 1990), and family acculturation (Kuczynski, Navara, & Boiger, 2011). For example, Boiger, Kuczynski, Le, and Osland (2008) found that immigrant teens often disagreed with their parents’ goals for them yet knew that their parents loved them. In response, teens worked to meet their own goals while resisting, negotiating, or

accommodating their parents’ desires. Mutual infuence has also been exam­ined in a handful of media studies. Katz (2010) described how bilingual Latinx children helped their Spanish-speaking parents answer or understand telephone calls, interpret documents, and connect to online resources. Parents’ choices of technologies (e.g., television vs. web services), and experi­ences (e.g., divorce, illness) afected children’s ability to act as the family media broker. Nabi and Krcmar (2016) found that children’s energetic temperament (as perceived by parents) afected parents’ use of media to help their child relax, to reward good behavior, and to give themselves a break.

  

Two studies are particularly relevant to the current project. Nelissen and Van Den Bulck (2018) surveyed parent-child dyads in Flanders, asking both partners about their social co-viewing of television (e.g., watching together for fun) and the frequency with which teens engaged in active mediation (e.g., explaining why something was good or bad) and restrictive mediation (e.g., saying they shouldn’t watch something). Parents and teens gave similar esti­mates, reporting the highest rates for co-viewing, followed by restrictive, and then active mediation. Teens’ restrictive mediation (but not co-viewing or active mediation) was associated with more parent-teen confict, with confict items focusing primarily on access to the television.

  

In a subsequent study, Nelissen, Kuczynski, Coenen, and Van Den Bulck (2019) repeatedly surveyed Belgian parents and their 10- to 18-year-old children, examining each partner’s Internet self-efcacy (e.g., confdence about ability to upload photos, block spam) and perceptions of their infuence on the other’s use of digital devices and platforms. They found signifcant concurrent but not longitudinal relationships: Those with more self-efcacy perceived themselves as exerting more infuence on their partner and were perceived by their partner as being less infuenced.

  

In sum, a few studies have examined mutual infuence in family media use. However, no studies have considered such dynamics in the context of the child’s identity development.

  

## LGBTQ identities as a locus for examining mutual infuence

  

In contrast to vertical identities that are shared with and socialized by parents (e.g., ethnicity, religion), LGBTQ identities have been described as horizontal, in that shared identity and socialization often occurs primarily with peers rather than parents (Solomon, 2012). Even in the subset of families where parents and children both have LGBTQ identities (Gartrell, Bos, & Koh, 2019), the standard dynamic of parental socialization may be disrupted if children feel more expert in their own particular identity and experiences. In this context, media content may serve as a tool for LGBTQ teens to socialize themselves and their parents, and as a locus of parental encouragement or resistance.

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/badec5b57d8dc7fe.jpg)

  

Prior work examined LGBTQ teens’ use of media (including online inter­actions and depictions targeted toward LGBTQ audiences) to clarify their identity to themselves (e.g., Bond, 2015; Gray, 2009), reducing the vacillation, hesitation, and confusion that characterize identity uncertainty (Cass, 1979). Winderman and Smith (2016) found that LGB adults with higher identity afrmation had stronger learning motivations for viewing LGB-inclusive TV and tended to watch such content more often. What the current project adds is an examination of LGBTQ teens’ agentic use of media to socialize their parents and, in the framework of social relational theory, teens’ perceptions of their parents’ responses and support.

  

Given the increased visibility of LGBTQ regular characters on broadcast networks, cable, and streaming services (GLAAD, 2020), the media environ­ment has opened the door for LGBTQ teens to use media content to educate their parents, elicit parental support, and spark identity-related conversations. Malici (2014) suggested such possibilities in writing about “queer TV moments” in which LGBTQ viewers encounter relevant characters or story­lines while co-viewing with heterosexual, cisgender family and friends. He argued that such moments may “promote reciprocal understanding, easing conficts” (p. 206), though his presentation of survey data (mostly from heterosexual respondents) included only two instances. Relatedly, Ghosh (2020) suggested that positive LGBTQ depictions may facilitate family rela­tionships after the child comes out, a premise reinforced by fndings that 75% of LGBTQ adults in an international survey believed that entertainment media depictions of LGBTQ characters improved their families’ understanding of the LGBTQ community (GLAAD, 2020).

  

Experimental and survey data indicate that likable LGBTQ characters can improve attitudes toward marginalized gender and sexual identities (e.g., Bond, 2020; Bond & Compton, 2015; Calzo & Ward, 2009; Gillig, Rosenthal, Murphy, & Folb, 2018). However, examination of such processes within families is largely limited to the GLAAD (2020) survey and a study of seven sexual minority teens and their parents in the US, in which teens reported that parental exposure to LGBTQ characters elicited family conversations about their sexual identities (Trussell, Xing, & Oswald, 2015).

  

## The Current Project

  

The current project unites these two emerging lines of work (i.e., mutual infuence and media use in families with LGBTQ children), focusing on US LGBTQ 18- and 19-year-olds. One goal was to examine the perceived fow of infuence in teens’ media-based behaviors and parental receptiv­ity to those behaviors. A second was to consider implications for teens’ perceptions of parental support for their LGBTQ identity and for their mental health.

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/43b66609f903499d.jpg)

  

A few methodological considerations merit foregrounding. Ideally, studies of mutual infuence should have data from both parties. However, asking parents whether their teen has tried to socialize them about their LGBTQ identity risks outing the teen or requires restricting the sample to dyads where the teen has already disclosed that identity and both individuals are comfor­table enough with the situation to voluntarily participate in LGBTQ-oriented research. Moreover, our focus was on implications for the teen (rather than the parent), so teens’ perceptions were arguably most crucial. Given these con­siderations, we did not include parents, and we surveyed 18- and 19-year-olds, conceptualizing “the child” as a family position relative to the parent that endures even after the passing of childhood itself. Focusing on this age-group provided a snapshot of what is often a pivotal developmental period. Sexual and gender identities continue to develop in late [adolescence](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md) for the majority of LGBTQ individuals (Shilo & Savaya, 2012) and a national survey of LGBT individuals in the US found that the median ages of coming out to family and/ or close friends ranged from 18 for gay men to 21 for lesbians (Pew, 2013). Thus, 18- and 19-year-olds are likely to be reporting not only retrospectively but also with regard to an ongoing process of articulating their identity to their parent.

  

Because this was an initial investigation in a novel area, and because of the challenges of recruiting and retaining LGBTQ teen samples (Meyer & Wilson, 2009), we conducted a cross-sectional survey. We began with an MTurk sample of 18- to 19-year-olds who indicated via screening questions that they identifed as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and/or queer (Study 1). After some unanticipated and marginally signifcant fndings, and responding to calls for replicability and “open science” in communication (e.g., Dienlin et al., 2020), we conducted Study 2, using the same questions and eligibility requirements with a larger sample recruited via the online polling company, Qualtrics. Thus, the latter sample involved those who had previously indicated to online panels (though not necessarily to their parents) that they identifed as LGBTQ (Study 2). Hypotheses and research questions laid out below apply to both studies.

  

Given that Malici (2014) reported only two instances of “queer TV moments,” RQ1 asked about the frequency with which participants recalled co-viewing LGBTQ depictions, encouraging their parents to see positive depictions, discouraging their parents from seeing problematic depictions (i.e., restrictive mediation), explicating or critiquing particular depictions (i.e., active mediation) with their parents, as well as the frequency of media- inspired conversations with parents about the teen’s own LGBTQ identities.

  

We then examined parent and child characteristics as predictors of these media-related behaviors. Given social relational theory’s key premise of mutual infuence, we had two expectations. First, parents who were perceived by the teen as generally supportive would more often create situations in 

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/badec5b57d8dc7fe.jpg)

  

which teens felt comfortable co-viewing and mediating LGBTQ content and discussing their identity. Second, we expected that the teen’s certainty about their LGBTQ identity would matter, just as Internet self-efcacy had predicted teens’ and parents’ perceptions of their infuence over each other’s digital media use in the study by Nelissen et al. (2019). Thus, we hypothesized that teens who perceived their parents to be more generally supportive (H1a) and who reported less identity uncertainty (H1b) would report engaging in more frequent LGBTQ-media-related behaviors with regard to their parents. To have the best chance of observing these associations, we asked teens to focus on their more generally supportive parent.

  

Continuing the examination of mutual infuence, we then focused on teens’ perceptions of their parents’ responses or likely responses to their co-viewing and mediation behaviors. Given that Nelissen and Van Den Bulck (2018) found that teens’ restrictive mediation (but not co-viewing or active media­tion) predicted family confict about television use, we expected that parents might be open to co-viewing LGBTQ content with their teen and even respond favorably when encouraged to watch positive depictions, yet respond more negatively (e.g., with reactance) when told not to watch something considered problematic by the teen. Even teens’ critiques or explanations of depictions might be seen as threatening to some parents, in the context of parent-teen relational changes (Branje, 2018). Thus, we predicted that LGBTQ teens would perceive more parental receptivity for co-viewing and encouragement than for restrictive and active mediation (H2). RQ2 asked about the types of parental responses experienced by LGBTQ teens.

  

We then considered the implications of LGBTQ-media-related behaviors and receptivity. Research suggests that LGBTQ youth experience widely vary­ing levels of parental support for their LGBTQ identities. Some are forced to leave the family home, told that their identities are a phase, or asked/required to conform to heteronormative displays; others receive expressions of uncon­ditional love, experience welcoming of romantic partners, and witness parent activism for LGBTQ rights (e.g., Higa et al., 2014; Roe, 2017). As noted earlier, various authors have suggested that moments of shared engagement with LGBTQ media content and ensuing conversations may help garner parental support for the teen’s LGBTQ identity (Ghosh, 2020; Malici, 2014; Trussell et al., 2015). While acknowledging the cross-sectional nature of our data, we examined whether the data yielded associations consistent with this line of reasoning. We predicted that frequency of teens’ LGBTQ-media-related beha­viors (co-viewing, mediation, media-inspired talk) (H3a), and perceptions of parental receptivity to co-viewing/mediation (H3b) would be associated with perceptions of more parental support for their LGBTQ identities.

  

Finally, we examined associations with teens’ mental health. Studies indi­cate higher rates of depression and suicidality among sexual and gender minorities than in the general population (Ream, 2019), particularly among

bisexual (Kuyper & Fokkema, 2011) and transgender youth (Liu & Mustanski, 2012). In reviewing this literature, Bryan and Maycock (2017) cautioned against reductive tropes that LGBTQ identities themselves contribute to men­tal ill-health, and Newcomb et al. (2019) argued for the need to study the role of family processes.

  

Various cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have found that parental support is positively associated with LGBTQ teens’ self-esteem (e.g., Homma & Saewyc, 2007) and negatively associated with depressive symptoms and other forms of psychological distress (D’Amico & Julien, 2012; D’Amico, Julien, Tremblay, & Chartrand, 2015). However, thus far, most studies have either measured parents’ general supportiveness (e.g., Needham & Austin, 2010) or parents’ support for their child’s LGBTQ identity (e.g., D’Amico et al., 2015; Kavanaugh, Taylor, Stuhlsatz, Neppl, & Lohman, 2020; Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010), but not both, leaving the unique contribution of identity support somewhat unclear. In a rare exception, Doty, Willoughby, Lindahl, and Malik (2010) asked LGB 14- to 21-year-olds about the likelihood that their family would support them with regard to sexuality- related stresses (e.g., discrimination, shame/guilt about their sexuality) versus other types of stresses. Although respondents perceived less familial support for sexuality-related stresses, it was this type of support (from family and friends) that was negatively associated with psychological distress, and that served as a bufer against sexuality-related stresses. Analyses examining gen­eral support found no associations with distress.

  

Given these fndings, we predicted that, even controlling for parents’ general supportiveness, teens’ self-esteem would be positively associated with their perceptions of their parents’ receptivity to their LGBTQ-media-related beha­viors (H4a) and their parents’ support for their LGBTQ identities (H4b). Conversely, we predicted that teens’ depressive symptoms would be negatively associated with perceived parental receptivity (H5a) and identity support (H5b).

  

## Study 1 Method

  

## Participants

  

Participants were recruited from MTurk, an online worker database. Given national diferences in the legal and social status of LGBTQ identities and given that this was an initial study, we restricted the listing to US residents. Also, because late teens had only just become eligible for MTurk, we did not require successful completion of prior MTurk assignments. The listing described a 20- minute survey about “media use and social relationships” (i.e., did not mention LGBTQ identities). One screening question asked about age. A second was designed to identify LGBTQ teens while reducing the odds that others might assume such an identity to participate. The item read, “People have many

Please check the top three that are most central to you,” followed by a list of 10 options (e.g., feminist, environmentalist, immigrant, politically liberal, politically conservative, LGBTQ). Only those who reported their age as 18 or 19 and selected LGBTQ proceeded to the consent page. To avoid multiple attempts, repeated logins from the same IP address were blocked. The two screening items eliminated 96% of those who clicked on the link. After removing 77 participants (for substantial incomplete data, failing two of three attention items asking them to select a specifc scale-point, or failing to repeat their LGBTQ identities in follow-up questions), the fnal N=276.

  

As shown in Table 1, 27% of teens in the fnal sample identifed as trans­gender or nonbinary. The most common sexual identity was bisexual (42%). Approximately 33% of teens identifed as racial-ethnic minorities; 78% lived with their parents at the time of the survey.

  

## Procedures

  

After providing consent, participants completed measures of self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and parental relationship quality. Parents were defned on the survey as the individuals most involved in raising the

participants. After rating general supportiveness for up to two parents, participants were instructed to focus on the higher-rated parent for the rest of the survey. Participants then chose which sexual or gender identity to focus on (subsequent items auto-flled with that identity), rated par­ental support for their identity, and then completed media-related and demographic items.

| -- | -- | -- | -- |

| Co-View | 2.85 (.96) | 2.53 (1.05) | Glee. What made it great to watch was seeing myself on screen and my parents liking the character |

| Receptivity Co-View | 3.40 (1.00) | 3.18 (1.19) | Sometimes, my mother and I will be watching tv and discover there is a lesbian character in the show. she often skips the parts which the lesbian character is in and It really hurts me even though i can’t say anything. |

| Encourage Positive | 3.23 (.92) | 2.88 (1.29) | I tried to get my mom to watch Brooklyn 99 so that we could watch Raymond Holt & Gina who both have diferent sexual identities and show her they’re just like her! They appreciated that I trusted them enough to share with them. |

| Receptivity Encourage | 3.47 (.95) | 3.12 (1.24) | when i started watching degrassi next class I encouraged my mom to watch it as well not only because of their take on depression and feelings of suicide but also because of their exposure on bisexual characters and it made me happy. my mom ended up watching a couple episodes with me !!! |

| Restrictive Mediation | 3.03 (1.02) | 2.34 (1.17) | I mentioned Alice from Superjail as a bad caricature of a transgender woman. He tried to understand and agreed to not watch it, but I don’t think he actually understood. |

| Receptivity Restrictive | 3.47 (.92) | 3.17 (1.21) | In twin peaks, I made a big deal that David Duchovny isn’t trans but he plays a character that is. I forbid my parents from watching such a disrespectful interpretation. |

| Active Mediation | 3.20 (.90) | 2.61 (1.17) | It was the L Word and I encouraged them to watch it because it sparked a conversation about how lesbians are portrayed in media and how they can be over sexualized and fetishized. |

| Receptivity Active | 3.43 (.91) | 3.21 (1.25) | I pointed out how Carrie Bradshaw’s character in one episode is very close- minded toward dating a bisexual man and how that perpetuates a harmful and real stigma that afects the community. As per usual when I try to engage with her about my identity in any sort of way, she ignored what I said and changed the conversation to avoid talking about it. |

| Media Inspired Talk | 3.04 (.93) | 2.31 (1.20) | Brooklyn 99 with Rosa Diaz coming out to her parents as bisexual . . . After watching, we had a conversation about my identity and how my experience compared/contrasted with the one being depicted onscreen. They reacted very well – both the viewing experience and discussion were enjoyable and productive I showed my mom Dan Howells coming out video and tried to show her that that was how I thought of things. My mom seemed open minded at frst but then turned the discussion into a religious route and it went downhill from there. |

  

  

Response options for all items ranged from 1– 5.

## Measures

  

Behavioral response options ranged from 1 (Never) to 5 (Almost Always). Attitudinal response options ranged from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). Measures were created for this study unless otherwise noted; items for original measures are given in Online Appendix A. Means were calculated for multi-item measures.

  

## Parent general supportiveness

  

As used by Martins, Mares, and Nathanson (2019), three items assessed parental supportiveness (e.g., “How often does he or she support you when you need it?”). Participants rated up to two parents (α=.77-.79); the higher value was used for analyses, both because the higher-rated parent was the focus throughout, and because the higher value was a more stringent control for associations between identity support and teens’ depressive symptoms.

  

## LGBTQ-media-related behaviors

  

Based on Valkenburg, Krcmar, Peeters, and Marseille (1999) measure of parental mediation, we assessed three types of teen mediation of their parents’ exposure to LGBTQ media (encouraging positive exposure, restrictive, and active mediation). Confrmatory factor analyses using robust full-information estimators (given Likert scales) showed adequate ft with the three-factor structure, $\chi ^ { 2 } / d f = 1 . 9 6 ,$p&lt;.001,CFI=.94,RMSEA=.06,SRMR=.05(Li, 2016). Items loaded as expected. We also measured co-viewing of LGBTQ- related content and media-inspired talk. We originally conceived of the latter as a separate behavior that might ensue from co-viewing/mediation. However, media-inspired talk and all three mediation types were correlated above .60 (see Online Appendix B) so we averaged co-viewing, encouragement, restric­tive mediation, active mediation, and media-inspired talk to create a single measure of LGBTQ-media-related behaviors (a=.93) to be used in tests of H3 – H5.

  

Co-viewing. In the absence of prior measures of co-viewing LGBTQ-related content, we created two items asking how often teens and their focal parent co- viewed movies, TV shows, or programs on streaming services like Netfix or Hulu that featured (1) characters that matched the teen’s sexual or gender identity, and (2) other LGBTQ characters (r=.63).

  

Encouraging positive exposure. Seven items (α = .91) assessed frequency of encouraging their parent to see positive depictions (e.g., TV shows or pro­grams that show “[sexual or gender identity] individuals living a happy life with their partners”).

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/ad6323ccd04ca3df.jpg)

  

Restrictive mediation. Six items (a=.89) assessed frequency of discouraging negative exposure (e.g., TV shows or programs that show “anti-[sexual or gender identity] humor”).

  

Active mediation. Six items(a=.86) assessed frequency of critiquing, explain­ing, or pointing out particular representations of LGBTQ characters or narra­tives (e.g., “criticized the way someone treated a [sexual or gender identity] character”).

  

Media-inspired talk. Seven items  (a=.90) asked how often identity- related media content led to identity-related discussions with their par­ent, including what the identity meant, being proud of their identity (e.g., “not being ashamed of being [sexual or gender identity]”).

  

## Parental receptivity

  

After each co-viewing and mediation scale, participants rated how their parent tended to respond or (if teens hadn’t engaged in the behavior) how they thought their parent would respond, using four 5-point seman­tic diferential items (e.g., very negative – very positive). Higher values on the 16 items (4 items x 4 scales) indicated more receptiveness (α = .96). The use of ratings of both actual and likely parental behavior was adopted from Valkenburg, Piotrowski, Hermanns, and De Leeuw (2013) study of teens’ reports of parental mediation styles.

  

## Open-ended questions

  

After the measure of co-viewing, an open-ended question asked, “Can you think of a specifc movie, TV show, or program featuring a [selected identity] individual that you really liked watching with your parent? What was it? If you have never . . ., please explain why.” After measures of active and restrictive mediation, encouragement, and media-inspired talk, a second open-ended question asked teens to describe an example of content they had encouraged, discouraged, critiqued, and/or that sparked a discussion. They then checked all that applied to their example (encour­aged, discouraged, critiqued, sparked discussion). Their categorizations were used in selecting examples for Table 2. A fnal open-ended item then asked, “how did your parent react to this TV show, movie, program, and/or discussion?”

## Outness to parent

  

After the second open-ended question, an item asked about the timing of this interaction: “before I even fully realized that I was [sexual or gender identity],” “while I was thinking of coming out to my parent,” “while I was coming out to my parent,” “after I frst came out to my parent.”

  

## Parent support for teen’s LGBTQ identity

  

Seven items (a=.89)were created to assess perceptions of their parent’s support for their identity (e.g., “My parent shows they love me, including my [sexual or gender] identity”).

  

## Identity uncertainty

  

The four-item (a=.87)identity uncertainty subscale from the measure of sexual minority identity (Mohr & Kendra, 2011) was used. Sample items include, “I can’t decide if this is really how I identify” and, “I’m not totally sure I identify this way”.

  

## Self-esteem

  

Rosenberg’s (1965), p. 10-item self-esteem measure(a=.79)was used (e.g., “I certainly feel useless at times” (reversed), “I feel that I have a number of good qualities”).

  

## Depressive symptoms

  

The Quinn et al. (2014) eight-item NIH PROMIS depressive symptoms scale (α = .91) was used. Participants noted how often in the past seven days they had various experiences (e.g., “I felt everything in my life went wrong”).

  

Covariates. Three items (a=.92)were created to assess perceived parental religiosity (“How religious is your parent?). Participants also reported coha­bitation with parents, geographic location, and race/ethnicity using single item measures.

  

## Study 1 Results

  

Analyses were conducted using close-ended measures; open-ended responses were used for illustration.

### Descriptive Analyses

  

Descriptive statistics and open-ended examples of teens’ LGBTQ media- related behaviors and their perceptions of their parents’ responses are given in Table 2.

  

### RQ1: LGBTQ-media-related behaviors

  

Over half the sample (60– 70%) reported co-viewing, encouraging, actively mediating, restricting, and discussing identity-related content at least some­times. As shown in Table 2, means were highest for encouraging positive exposure yet lowest for co-viewing. Explanations for not co-viewing refer­enced a lack of identity-specifc depictions, parental opposition to LGBTQ identities, fear that co-viewing would be “awkward” or expose their undi­sclosed identities, and that such content was private. Overall, just under 2% of participants (n=5)said they had never engaged in any of the fve behaviors with their parent.

  

### RQ2: parental receptivity

  

As shown in Table 2, means were near the mid-point, but this masks varia­bility. Roughly 24% (n=65)of teens rated their parent’s receptivity to co- viewing as somewhat or very negative, 10% (n=27)rated receptivity at the midpoint, and roughly 67% (n=184)rated it as somewhat or very positive. Similar patterns emerged for encouragement, restrictive, and active mediation, albeit the percent rated as neutral was higher and the percent rated as negative was lower (see Online Appendix C).

  

### Context: teens’ outness

  

Of the 257 teens who described a specifc instance of mediation or media- inspired discussion, 28% (n=71)said it occurred before they fully realized their identity, 35% (n = 91) while they were thinking of coming out to their parent, 17%(n=44) while they were coming out to their parent, and 21%(n=55) after they frst came out to their parent. Thus, LGBTQ-media-related behaviors occurred across various stages of coming out. An additional 19 participants did not describe an instance and/or indicate their outness.

  

### Inferential Analyses

  

Given the cross-sectional, non-experimental nature of our data, we did not conduct mediation analyses (see Bullock, Green, & Ha, 2010). Instead, we conducted eight hierarchical linear regressions, examining predictors of the fve media-related behaviors, perceived identity support, and self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Covariates included the participant’s race/ethnicity (given that Whites perceive more acceptance of LGBT identities than non-

Whites, Pew, 2013), perceptions of their parent’s religiosity (given that highly religious parents respond more negatively to their child’s coming out, Baiocco et al., 2015), and whether they lived with their parent (given that cohabitation would create more opportunity for media-related behaviors). Additionally, because transgender, non-binary, and bisexual individuals (vs. cis-gender gay men and lesbians) report less acceptance (Pew, 2013) and more depression (Liu & Mustanski, 2012), we coded gender as trans/non-binary versus cisgen­der, and sexual identity as bisexual vs. other, and included these codes as covariates. Because outness was reported only in relation to one instance of media-related behavior, we did not include it as a covariate in the main analyses.1

  

### H1: predicting LGBTQ-media-related behaviors

  

H1 proposed that all fve LGBTQ- media-related behaviors would be positively associated with parent general supportiveness (H1a) and negatively associated with teen identity uncertainty (H1b). As Table 3 shows, parent general sup­portiveness was associated with more frequent mediation (encouraging, restrictive, active) and media-inspired talk, but not co-viewing. Thus, H1a was largely supported. Identity uncertainty was associated with more (rather than less) encouragement, restrictive mediation, and media-inspired talk; it was unrelated to active mediation or co-viewing. Thus, H1b was not sup­ported. Additionally, all fve LGBTQ-media-related behaviors were unexpect­edly positively associated with parental religiosity but showed few associations with teens’ ethnicity/race, cohabitation with their parents, and sexual and gender identities.

  

### H2: parental receptivity to co-viewing and mediation

  

H2 predicted that teens would perceive more parental receptivity to co- viewing and encouragement than to active or restrictive mediation. The means in Table 2 and results of a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed no diferences in ratings of parental receptivity for the four media-related behaviors, Wilks’ Lambda=.985,F(3,273)=1.403,p=.242. H2 was not supported.

  

### H3: predicting perceived support for teen’s LGBTQ identity

  

H3 predicted that teens who reported more frequent LGBTQ-media-related behaviors (H3a) and more parental receptivity to co-viewing/mediation (H3b) would perceive more parental support for their LGBTQ identity. As shown in Table 4, after entering the set of covariates including perceptions of parent general supportiveness, both H3a and H3b were supported.

  

Additionally, perceptions of identity support were positively associated with parent general supportiveness and (unexpectedly) parental religiosity.

### H4: predicting self-esteem

  

H4 predicted that, even after controlling for parent general supportiveness, teens who perceived more parental receptivity to co-viewing/mediation of LGBTQ media and more parental support for their LGBTQ identity would report higher levels of self-esteem. As Table 4 shows, parental receptivity was associated with higher self-esteem (supporting H4a), but identity support was not (contrary to H4b). Additionally, self-esteem was positively associated with parent general supportiveness, and negatively associated with teen identity uncertainty and (surprisingly) positively associated with parental religiosity.

  

### H5: predicting depressive symptoms

  

H5 paralleled H4, though associations were expected to be negative (i.e., fewer symptoms at higher levels of receptivity and identity support). As Table 4 shows, the same patterns were observed as for self-esteem albeit the signifcant negative association between parental receptivity and depressive symptoms did not produce signifcant R2 change. Thus, H5 was only weakly supported.

  

## Study 1 Summary

  

The results of Study 1 suggest that social relational theory can be applied in the context of identity management. LGBTQ teens reported co-viewing and mediation of LGBTQ identity-related media content with their par­ents, especially teens who reported stronger general parental support and those who were more uncertain of their LGBTQ identities. Very few participants had never engaged in these behaviors, although restrictive mediation was slightly less prevalent than other forms. Two-thirds of participants reported that LGBTQ media messages inspired conversations about their identity, most commonly conversations about LGBTQ equal rights. Teens’ LGBTQ-media-related behaviors and parental receptivity to these behaviors were associated with teens’ perceptions that their parent supported their LGBTQ identity. Consistent with mutual infuence, par­ents’ general supportiveness and receptivity to co-viewing/mediation were positively related to teens’ self-esteem and negatively related to teens’ depressive symptoms. However, there were unexpected fndings for par­ental religiosity and identity uncertainty. We sought to replicate Study 1 with a diferent sample of LGBTQ teens.

## Study 2 Method

  

## Participants

  

An online polling company, Qualtrics, recruited 369 US 18- or 19-year- olds who had identifed themselves as LGBTQ (to pollsters, though maybe not to their parents). We screened for IP addresses that had been used in Study 1. As shown in Table 1, gender identities difered markedly from Study 1, with 73% identifying as cisgender female and 12% as non-binary. Over half the sample identifed as bisexual (59%), and close to half (46%) identifed as racial-ethnic minorities. Other variables (e.g., parent religi­osity, cohabiting) largely resembled Study 1.

  

## Measures

  

The same measures used in Study 1 assessed parent general supportive­ness (a=.87-92), LGBTQ-media-related behaviors (a=.94), parental receptivity (α=.98), LGBTQ identity support (a=.96),, identity uncer­tainty (a=.89), self-esteem (a=.89), depressive symptoms (α=.93),, and parental religiosity (a=.89). A new measure of participant religiosity used the same scale as parental religiosity, worded in the frst person (e.g., How often do you pray?, a=.77).

  

## Study 2 Results

  

### Descriptive Analyses

  

#### RQ1: LGBTQ media-related behaviors

  

A third to half the sample (33– 53%) reported co-viewing, encouraging, actively mediating, restricting, and discussing identity-related content at least sometimes. As shown in Table 2 (and as in Study 1), encouraging positive exposure was most common, though means were tightly clus­tered. As in Study 1, discussion focused most on LGBTQ equal rights and least on LGBTQ sexual health issues (of topics listed). Only 4% (n=16)said they had never engaged in any of the fve LGBTQ media behaviors with their parent.

  

### RQ2: parental receptivity

  

Teens’ perceptions of their parents’ receptivity to co-viewing and media­tion varied considerably. Roughly 30–37% of teens rated their parents’ responses as somewhat or very negative, 15–25% were at the neutral midpoint, and 30–45% rated their parent as having somewhat or very positive reactions (see Online Appendix B for details).

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/a5cc72d66e4171e6.jpg)

  

### Context: teen’s outness

  

Of the 368 teens who described a specifc instance of co-viewing, mediation, or media-inspired discussion, 28% (n = 104) said it occurred before they fully realized their identity, 30% (n = 109) while they were thinking of coming out to their parent, 11%(n=40)while they were coming out to their parent, and 31%(n=1115) after they frst came out to their parent. (One participant did not respond to these prompts.) Thus, as in Study 1, LGBTQ-media-related beha­viors occurred across various stages of coming out.

  

### Inferential Analyses

  

We conducted the same analyses as in Study 1, adding participants’ own religiosity.

  

#### H1: predicting media-related behaviors

  

H1 proposed that all fve LGBTQ-media-related behaviors would be positively associated with parent general supportiveness (H1a) and negatively associated with teen identity uncertainty (H1b). As shown in Table 3, parents’ general supportiveness was positively associated with co-viewing, active mediation, and media-inspired talk, but not encouragement or restrictive mediation. Thus, H1a was partly supported as in Study 1. Identity uncertainty was unrelated to all fve behaviors, contrary to H1b (and Study 1). Additionally, parental religiosity was positively associated with restrictive mediation (as in Study 1), but negatively associated with co-viewing and was unrelated to encouragement, active mediation, and media-inspired talk. Adjusted $R ^ { 2 } s$were markedly lower than in Study 1.

  

### H2: parental receptivity to co-viewing and mediation

  

H2 proposed that teens would perceive parents as more receptive to co- viewing and encouragement than to active or restrictive mediation. A repeated measures ANOVA found no diferences in receptivity, Wilks’ Lamda=.984,F(3,366)=2.032,p=.109. As in Study 1, H2 was not supported.

  

### H3: predicting parental support for teen’s LGBTQ identity

  

H3 predicted that teens who reported more frequent LGBTQ-media-related behaviors (H3a) and more parental receptivity to co-viewing/mediation (H3b) would perceive more parental support for their LGBTQ identity. As shown in Table 4, after entering the set of covariates including perceptions of general parental supportiveness, both H3a and 3b were supported (as in Study 1). Additionally, identity support was positively associated with parents’ general supportiveness, but negatively associated with parent religiosity, and teen identity uncertainty and bisexual identity.

  

### H4: predicting self-esteem

  

H4 proposed that, even after controlling for general parental supportiveness, teens who perceived more parental receptivity to co-viewing/mediation of LGBTQ media and more parental support for their LGBTQ identity would report higher levels of self-esteem. As shown in Table 4, parental receptivity was not signifcantly associated with self-esteem (contrary to H4a and Study 1), but perceived identity support was positively associated with self- esteem (consistent with H4b, contrary to Study 1).

  

Additionally, self-esteem was higher among those who reported more general supportiveness from their parent, and who identifed as participants of color and cisgender.

  

### H5: predicting depressive symptoms

  

H5 paralleled H4, though associations were expected to be negative (i.e., fewer symptoms at higher levels of receptivity and identity support). As with self- esteem, teens’ depressive symptoms were not associated with parental recep­tivity (contrary to H4a and Study 1), but were negatively associated with perceptions of parental support for their LGBTQ identities (consistent with H5b and contrary to Study 1). Additionally, teens who reported more general parental supportiveness and those who identifed as cisgender (vs. trans or non-binary) reported fewer depressive symptoms.

  

## Study 2 Summary

  

Co-viewing, mediation, and media-inspired talk were common among LGBTQ teens; only 4% had never engaged in any LGBTQ-media-related behavior. Parents’ general supportiveness was associated with more frequent co-viewing, active mediation, and media-inspired talk while identity uncer­tainty was unrelated to all. LGBTQ-media-related behaviors and parental receptivity to these behaviors were positively associated with perceptions of parental support for LGBTQ identities. Even controlling for general suppor­tiveness, perceived identity support was associated with higher self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms.

  

## Discussion

  

The central aim of this project was to explore social relational theory’s core premise of mutual parent-child infuence within the context of media use and identity development. We proposed that LGBTQ teens make agentic use of media depictions to socialize their parents about their sexual or gender identity, and that these experiences, together with perceptions of their parents’ receptivity to these experiences, may shape teens’ perceptions that their par­ents support their LGBTQ identity. Further, we considered it possible that 

  

there would be implications for teens’ self-esteem and depressive symptoms. Below, we discuss the fndings with regard to each of these points, before considering limitations and future directions.

  

## Replication and Discrepancies in Studies 1 and 2

  

## LGBTQ-media-related behaviors and receptivity

  

Malici (2014) reported few instances of queer media moments in his sample, but both studies here provided robust evidence that LGBTQ teens used media depictions to socialize parents about their sexual or gender identity. In both studies, such use occurred at various stages of coming out (from pre-clarity to post-disclosure) and was perceived as being met with widely varying levels of parental receptivity.

  

In both studies, encouraging positive exposure was the most frequent behavior, with somewhat lower means for co-viewing hinting at a gap between desired and actual experiences. In both studies, explanations for not co- viewing included lack of identity-relevant content, desire for privacy, and fear of parental reactions. Indeed, parental receptivity, as perceived by teens, varied widely. Nonetheless, both studies found that, contrary to H2, parents were perceived to be as receptive to restrictive and active mediation as to co- viewing and encouragement.

  

### Predicting the frequency of media behaviors

  

Social relational theory implies that teens’ attempts to infuence their parents’ exposure to LGBTQ depictions will depend on characteristics of both partners (Kuczynski & Parkin, 2009). We expected that co-viewing and mediation would be more common for teens who perceived their parents to be more generally supportive and who reported less uncertainty about their LGBTQ identities. Both studies yielded some support for the former prediction – parents’ general supportiveness was associated with more mediation and media-inspired talk in Study 1, and more co-viewing, active mediation, and talk in Study 2. However, our prediction was not supported for identity uncertainty. In Study 1, uncer­tainty was associated with more frequent media-related behaviors; in Study 2 there were no associations. Further work is needed to examine how identity uncertainty is related to feelings of efcacy about broaching identity-related issues with parents. It may be, for example, that those who are more uncertain of their identity turn to parents and media simultaneously to glean information and solicit support during the process of crystallizing their identities.

  

## Predicting perceptions of identity support

  

We examined the as-yet untested argument that moments of shared engage­ment with LGBTQ media content may help garner parental support for the teen’s LGBTQ identity (Ghosh, 2020; Malici, 2014; Trussell et al., 2015). That 

  

  

![](https://web-api.textin.com/ocr_image/external/c9242d57574f83e4.jpg)

  

is, we hypothesized that teens who reported more LGBTQ-media-related behaviors and parental receptivity would perceive more support for their identities. Both predictions were supported in both studies, even controlling for perceptions of general supportiveness and other covariates.

  

Of course, these are likely to be reciprocal, reinforcing associations, such that teens’ behaviors shape their parents’ responses, and identity support generates more such moments. It is precisely this reciprocity that lies at the heart of social relational theory, and we were unable to capture how such associations play out over time. The examples in Table 2 and the widely varying levels of perceived receptivity suggest the need to probe not only positive spirals of increasing understanding and support, but also negative spirals where teens’ perceptions of their parents’ hostile responses may have chilling efects, foreclosing further disclosure and support.

  

## Predicting mental health

  

Doty et al. (2010) argued that identity-related support would be more crucial to LGBTQ youths’ mental health than other forms of support because it would be more relevant to the key stressors that they experienced. Accordingly, we predicted that perceptions of parental receptivity to LGBTQ-media-related behaviors and identity support would be associated with better mental health, even controlling for general supportiveness. In both studies, we found that general supportiveness was associated with more self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms. In both studies, we also found that identity-related variables were additionally associated with both of these mental health vari­ables (consistent with Doty et al.’s arguments), but in Study 1 it was perceived receptivity that was signifcant and in Study 2 it was perceived identity sup­port. The overall pattern points to the importance of both general and identity-relevant support, but the specifcs varied.

  

## Other fndings

  

There were several other puzzles including the unusual fndings for parental religiosity in Study 1 that largely vanished in Study 2, and that made it important to try to replicate our focal fndings. Prior work has highlighted the particular vulnerabilities of bisexual and transgender/non-binary teens, but we saw relatively little indication of such diferences in our samples. Cohabitation, which might have been expected to afect the frequency of media-related behaviors, showed few associations.

  

## Study 1 and 2 discrepancies

  

In sum, results for H2 (parental receptivity to media behaviors) and H3 (predictors of identity support) were replicated; results for H1 (predictors of media behaviors) and H4 and H5 (predictors of self-esteem and depressive symptoms) showed some inconsistencies. One possible explanation for the

latter discrepancies concerns measurement error. We used validated scales for self-esteem, depressive symptoms and identity uncertainty, and an extant scale for general supportiveness, but (in the absence of prior work) created our own multi-item measures for LGBTQ-media-related behaviors, as well as identity support (given that the latter often is assessed by a single item, e.g., Pastrana, 2015). Although reliability was high for all measures in both studies, and although we aggregated across media-related behaviors in analyses predicting self-esteem and depressive symptoms (i.e., the aggregate variable contained 27 items), it is possible that error contributed to discrepant fndings.

  

A second, not incompatible, possibility is that discrepancies refect sample diferences. The Study 2 sample was gathered 7 months after Study 1. It was bigger, and it contained many more cis-gender females, fewer teens who identifed as transgender or nonbinary, fewer who identifed as lesbian or gay, and more who identifed as bisexual. Perhaps even more relevantly, the Study 2 sample consisted wholly of teens who had disclosed their LGBTQ identity to others (i.e., Qualtrics). Relative to Study 1 teens, they reported slightly less parental support for their LGBTQ identity, slightly lower self- esteem, slightly more frequent depressive symptoms, and less frequent LGBTQ-media-related behaviors. These diferences hint at the importance of examining how media use, family support and communication, and teens’ mental health may unfold over time, as individuals move through the process of coming out to family and others.

  

## Key Limitations and Directions for Further Work

  

This project had important methodological limitations, particularly the use of cross-sectional data from teens only, to try to capture dyadic interactions over time. As we noted in the introduction, the focus on teens refected both practical and ethical considerations, but it undoubtedly weakened our ability to describe mutual efects. Of course, even the gold standard of such research – several waves of data from both parent and child – faces the challenge of identifying the right time intervals to capture moments when contradictory working models lead to change. Moreover, such work cannot capture brief sequences where infuence ricochets back and forth. Thus, further research might include not only longitudinal surveys, but also repeated bursts of ecological momentary assessments to tease apart short- and long-term dynamics.

  

It is also important to acknowledge that LGBTQ teens in MTurk or Qualtrics panels probably difer from LGBTQ teens who are not engaged with these platforms or who are too uncertain or too afraid to disclose their LGBTQ identities online even with assurances of anonymity. Relatedly, we asked these teens to focus on the parent they perceived as most generally supportive. Exploring the boundary conditions of teens’ infuence over parents

who are generally unsupportive and who deeply oppose LGBTQ identities is an important arena for further work, as is the need to examine emotional efects on the parent. Finally, we restricted our samples to US 18- and 19-year- olds, thereby limiting generalizability to other ages and settings.

  

Additional theoretical depth could come from examining trickle up socia­lization for vertical versus horizontal identities. Are co-viewing and mediation of television characters and narratives more efective for socializing parents about shared identities like race or class, or potentially unshared identities like disability status or political ideology? For what types of identities do parents grant or withhold teens’ expertise and power?

  

Despite the limitations of this initial project, we present it as an invitation to others and a challenge to ourselves. We see it as highlighting the value of considering mutual infuence with regard to use of media content that may infuence identity formation, power-sharing, and positive family communica­tion. As such, it builds on the work of scholars who have pushed us to move beyond top-down models of child socialization.
