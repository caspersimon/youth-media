Understanding the workings of race in a multiracial society is a complex, multidimen sional phenomenon. First, this understanding includes multiple types of beliefs. Racial attitudes are believed to include three components: stereotyping (the cognitive compo nent), prejudice (the evaluative component), and discrimination (the behavioral com ponent) (Levy, Lytle, Shin, & Hughes, 2015). Much of the existing research on children’s racial attitudes has focused on prejudice, centering on their positive and negative feel ings toward a racial group and its members or on preferences, such as those assessed in the classic Clark and Clark doll studies. Second, racial attitudes are multidimensional concerning the forces contributing to their development. Tese attitudes are believed to develop early with contributions from internal sources, such as perceptual abilities and categorization skills, and external forces, such as models and values provided by parents, peers, teachers, and the media. Indeed, because the media provide a steady stream of models and storylines and are consumed by youth for numerous hours a day,they are especially poised to ofer formative information about race.

  

Tis entry examines contributions of media use to the development of racial attitudes and stereotypes. Although many reviews have addressed this general domain,most have focused on media content or on efects among adults (e.g., Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013; Mastro, 2017). Te entry reviews research testing contributions of media use to young people’s racial attitudes with a focus on studies of youth aged 18and younger. Te literature in this feld is not large but, by drawing attention to it and its insights and limitations, fuel is provided for future research. Because both media content and U.S. race relations have changed over time, research from 1995 and later is the focus. First, theoretical perspectives on how racial attitudes develop are reviewed.Second, developmental milestones are summarized and studies in three areas are presented: media contributions to White youth’s racial attitudes, media contributions to how people of color (POC) view themselves, and media contributions to how POC view other ethnic minority groups.

## Theoretical perspectives on how children develop racial attitudes and stereotypes

  

Te process via which children’s racial attitudes develop has been explained using a diverse set of theories. According to [social learning](Definitions/theories/Social%20cognitive%20(learning)%20theory%20(Bandura).md) approaches, children are assumed to acquire racial attitudes by observing and imitating others in their environments, such as their parents, teachers, and friends. Tis set of others also includes media portrayals.A second approach is cognitive developmental theorizing (for review, see Levy et al.,2015), which highlights the skills that children acquire with age that allow them to understand race in more complex ways. Tese cognitive skills include categorization,role-taking ability, and the ability to hold multiple and varied attitudes toward a person or group. Younger children are believed to focus on surface features and to exaggerate diferences between groups. As their cognitive systems mature, children can better rec ognize similarities across groups and diferences within a group, allowing for less rigid views of groups and their members.

  

A third approach is the developmental intergroup theory (DIT; Bigler & Liben, 2007).Within this theory, three core processes are believed to contribute to the formation of social stereotyping and prejudice: (i) establishing the psychological salience of difer ent person attributes, (ii) categorizing individuals by these salient dimensions, and (iii)accumulating sets of behaviors, traits, and emotions that are associated with salient social groups (Bigler & Liben, 2007). Te DIT argues that intergroup biases develop if a social dimension is psychologically salient. Psychological salience is infuenced by four factors: the perceptual salience of groups, unequal group size, explicit labeling of group membership, and implicit segregation. Because these four factors characterize society’s treatment of race and ethnicity, children are likely to view race as an impor tant dimension along which individuals vary. Tus, the argument is that when groups are labeled, treated, or sorted diferently, children come to conceptualize the groups as diferent in meaningful ways and to construct hypotheses (such as racial stereotypes)about the nature and importance of these diferences (Bigler & Liben, 2007).

  

Although these three theories do not directly address the role of the media in shaping racial attitudes, media content is believed to be a prominent force that could help develop, maintain, and activate racial group stereotypes. Media content could contribute to the formation of stereotypes by directing attention to features of certain groups and not others (Mastro, 2017). Frequent exposure to these media stereotypes could also make them chronically accessible, easily activated, and more likely to be applied in the future. Two prominent media theories are ofen raised to support these premises. One theory is cultivation theory, which argues that repeated, long-term exposure to commonly portrayed media messages fosters analogous beliefs in media users, regardless of the accuracy of the depictions. A second framework supporting research in this area is [social cognitive theory](Definitions/theories/Social%20cognitive%20(learning)%20theory%20(Bandura).md). Here, the expectation is that viewers’beliefs are shaped by their observing, identifying with, and following the rewarded actions of media models. In turn, these beliefs shape individuals’ behavior.

  

## Developmental milestones in children’s understanding of racial categories

  

Children’s understanding of racial categories and racial stereotypes develops gradually over time, with attention to race emerging in [infancy](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) (for review, see Hailey & Olson,2013). Although [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) do not have vocabulary to articulate their thoughts about race,we can derive evidence of this understanding by examining their visual perceptions. It appears that the facial processing system may be unspecifed at birth, in that newborns do not demonstrate spontaneous preferences for own- or other-race faces. However,this system becomes more refned over time, as [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) accumulate information about their surroundings. By 3 to 6 months of age, some [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) begin to show preference for own-race faces over other-race faces. Tese fndings suggest that some 3-month-old [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) can discriminate perceptually between diferent racial groups and prefer to look at faces that belong to a familiar racial group. Tis hallmark signals the development of the other-race efect (ORE), in which [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) become experts at recognizing own-race faces, ofen at the expense of recognizing other-race faces. However, ORE is not a uni versal event, as [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) living in racially heterogeneous environments do not seem to develop ORE at the same time as [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) in racially homogeneous environments. By 6to 12 months of age, [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) develop more specialized facial processing systems, and become better at encoding race-specifc features.

  

Abilities improve during the preschool years, ages 3–6, during which children can perceptually diferentiate racial and ethnic groups and also develop attitudinal and afective associations with race. However, these associations are ofen heavily based on external and physical manifestations of race, such as skin color or accent (Quin tana, 1998). During this time, children in the ethnic majority group (e.g., European American children in the United States) show signs of implicit and explicit ingroup favoritism, assigning positive attributes to their ingroup and negative attributes to outgroups (Hailey & Olson, 2013). Ingroup favoritism is less strong and consistent among children from lower-status groups, who sometimes even exhibit preferences for the higher-status group (i.e., Clark and Clark doll preference studies) (Hailey & Olson,2013). During this time, children also use racial categories to guide their judgments and expectations about individuals they have never encountered (Quintana, 1998).

  

By [middle childhood](Definitions/Age%20ranges/middle%20childhood.md), ages 6–10, children shif from a tendency of relying on exter nal and physical distinctions to conceptualizing race based more on unobservable,inferred characteristics. Consequently, racial bias declines, as children can hold more complex and integrated views of racial groups, become aware of individual diferences within groups, and recognize similarities across groups (Quintana, 1998). Children also develop a greater awareness of the social norm that racial discrimination is frowned upon and become motivated to hide explicit ingroup bias (Hailey & Olson, 2013).From ages 10–14, children are believed to shif from conceptualizing race based on its literal features and associations to understanding some of the social realities associated with race and ethnicity, such as diferences in social class (Quintana, 1998). During adolescence, children are believed to work more closely on their own ethnic group consciousness and ethnic identity (Quintana, 1998).

  

### Does media use affect White youth’s views of POC?

  

Given the contributions of experience and environmental exposure in shaping beliefs about race, the question then becomes: what role does media use play in teaching chil dren about race? Very little scholarship has investigated the impact of media exposure on White youths’ perceptions of POC. A few recent studies have examined how depic tions of Black Americans infuence White youths’ perceptions. Castelli, De Dea, and Nesdale (2008) tested how viewing nonverbal interracial reactions infuences White children’s perceptions of Black Americans. In Study 1, 78 White children aged three to six were shown a videotaped interaction in which a White and Black adult were talking.Te White adults displayed friendly or neutral verbal behavior, and either easy or uneasy nonverbal behavior. Te experimenters then asked the children questions concerning how the White adult might feel about the Black adult and concerning the children’s own perceptions of the Black adult. As expected, children who had viewed the positive non verbal behavior perceived the interactions more positively and viewed the Black adult more positively than those who had viewed negative nonverbal behavior. Te authors replicated this efect in Study 2, and also demonstrated that children’s positive percep tions extended to a Black adult who was not featured in the video.

  

Using a similar approach, Jordan and Hernandez-Reif (2009) examined whether exposure to a story featuring a Black child as a hero might increase positive perceptions of Black youth. Tis study extended the classic Clark and Clark research in which Black children showed preference for White dolls instead of Black ones. Afer exposure to either the Black hero story or a neutral story, participants (20 Black children and 20 White children aged 3–5) were shown cartoon depictions of a Black child and a White child who were identical except for skin color. Participants were asked which child they would like as their best friend, which one looks bad, and which one looks like you. Despite the intervention, White children in the experimental group were still more likely to say the Black child looked bad and were more likely to choose the White cartoon children as their best friend.

  

An experimental study with older youth showed opposing evidence, fnding that exposure to Black-oriented media may increase pro-Black perceptions. Zillmann and colleagues (1995) investigated whether exposure to political rap would impact the racial harmony and rejection of White supremacist attitudes in 74 White high schoolers. Stu dents in the political rap condition were shown four music videos of progressive politi cal rap, which the authors described as having themes of social protest and descriptions of the oppression of Black Americans. Other participants were shown popular rock videos or nonpolitical rap videos. Afer viewing the videos, participants were asked to evaluate the viability of fctional candidates for a local university’s student government and were shown slides of each candidate and were exposed to an audiotape of their platforms. Unexpectedly, across music video conditions, participants indicated stronger support for the liberal Black candidate than for the liberal White candidate. As expected,support was stronger for the Black liberal candidate afer exposure to political rap com pared to the other genres. In addition, students exposed to political rap indicated less support for the White supremacist candidate compared to those in other music genre conditions.

  

Tis work has also extended to social media use. Maxwell and Schulte (2018) used an online survey to examine White millennials’ racial resentment in relation to social media use and their parents’ racial attitudes. In 2012, the researchers surveyed 667White parents and 621 White millennials aged 12–17. Racial resentment was measured using a scale that captured anti-Black attitudes. Similar overall rates of racial resent ment emerged between adult and youth samples. Video game use was associated with higher levels of youth racial resentment; use of Facebook and Twitter was not signif cantly associated with youth racial resentment.

  

### Interventions for prejudice reduction

  

Several studies have tested the ability of media with pro-diversity messaging to reduce prejudice in children. Persson and Musher-Eizenman (2003) used a pre- and posttest design to examine potential efects in two studies among White children ages 3 to 6.First, children’s racial preferences were tested using diferent race dolls (Black, White,and Asian); participants indicated which doll looks bad and which one they wanted to play with and were then asked to indicate the degree to which they liked the doll.Te children then viewed 10 minutes of a television program with a multiracial cast and aferward were given the same racial preference assessment given in the pretest.Surprisingly, television exposure had no efect on their preferences, and participants continued to prefer the White stimuli. Study 2 also found no signifcant diferences in children’s racial preferences, even though the children now viewed the pro-diversity TV content four times.

  

Vittrup and Holden (2011) tested whether a video intervention might infuence chil dren’s racial preferences if their parents were involved. Teir sample consisted of 93White children, aged 3 to 6, and their parents. Participants were assigned to one of four conditions: control, video only, video and discussion, and discussion only. Tose assigned to the control group completed surveys but had no intervention. Parents in video conditions were instructed to show their children one 15-minute video segment with pro-diversity messages at home, every day for fve days. Te discussion groups were instructed to talk about the videos with their children. Te children were surveyed con cerning their pro- and anti-Black attitudes and their perceptions of their parents’ views toward Black people. Children reported signifcantly more positive views toward White people compared to Black people; further, their attitudes were not correlated with their parents’ attitudes, but their perceptions of their parents’ attitudes were correlated with their own. Analyses of the intervention conditions indicated that outgroup attitudes improved with either parental discussion or videos, but not both.

  

Finally, a unique set of studies has used storybooks to help improve children’s acceptance of outgroup members (for a discussion of these studies, see Vezzali,Stathi, Giovannini, Capozza, & Trifletti, 2015). Tis body of work draws on the extended contact hypothesis, which argues that merely being exposed to intergroup friendships between a member of one’s own group and another group can improve intergroup attitudes. In the initial study, which was an intervention conducted among 253 British children aged 5 to 11, participants were read stories over six weeks that

  

featured friendships between White British children and refugees. Tere were three experimental conditions, in which particular similarities between the ingroup and outgroup characters were emphasized, and a control condition that received no stories.Afer each reading session, children participated in a small group discussion of the story. As expected, when tested two weeks afer the intervention, attitudes toward refugees were more positive for youth in the experimental conditions than for those in the control condition. Subsequent studies replicated this general fnding, and also indicated that the increase in positive attitudes is especially strong among children who identify more strongly with their English heritage and among children who report less high-quality direct contact with immigrants.

  

Tis work has also extended to more naturalistic investigations. In one feld exper iment conducted among Italian adolescents, the researchers demonstrated that youth who read a book on intercultural topics, and therefore experienced vicarious contact with other cultures, reported more positive attitudes toward immigrants, endorsed less negative intergroup stereotypes, and were more willing to engage in future contact with immigrants compared to participants in the control conditions. Similar fndings were reported among Italian ffh graders; here, reading and discussing Harry Potter pas sages that were related to prejudice predicted more positive attitudes toward immigrants among students who identifed with Harry.

  

#### Does media use affect minority youth’s views of themselves?

  

#### Findings among Black youth

  

Although information is sparse concerning the contributions of Black youth’s media use to their racial attitudes, a few studies have examined connections between their media use and self-perceptions (for a discussion of many of these studies, see Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013; Mastro, 2017). In a 1995 study, 46 Black boys ages 11 to16 were exposed either to eight violent rap videos, eight nonviolent rap videos, or no music videos, and were then assessed regarding their academic aspirations. Boys in both the violent and nonviolent rap music video groups reported having a greater desire to be materialistic and were more likely to believe that a Black man would not complete law school afer watching the videos. In a 2015 study, 247 Black adolescents were surveyed concerning their exposure to Black sitcoms and Black music/music videos and their academic self-perceptions (i.e., beliefs about math and science abilities). Researchers found that youth who watched more hours per week of Black sitcoms perceived themselves to be less capable of doing well in science. Similar results have emerged in an experimental setting. Terefore, not only may Black media shape Black adolescents’ self-perceptions,but they may also promote stereotypical images of Black people (e.g., uneducated).

  

Researchers have also investigated the efects of media use on Black youth’s accep tance of gendered racial stereotypes. Anyiwo, Ward, Day Fletcher, and Rowley (2018)tested whether diferent forms of TV use contribute to Black adolescents’ endorsement of the strong black woman (SBW) schema, a stereotype that Black women have the

  

natural mental and physical capability to withstand difcult situations. Although there was no association between total hours spent watching TV and endorsement of the SBW, more frequent consumption of Black-oriented TV programs was associated with stronger endorsement of the SBW schema.

  

Other mechanisms besides exposure level have proven to be infuential, especially youth’s identifcation with Black or non-Black characters. Tenets of social cognitive the ory would predict that media efects would be stronger if levels of identifcation are higher, and that youth of color may identify more readily with like characters. Tese results have only been partially born out and difer by developmental and cognitive stage. Among a sample of preschool children, Black participants initially expressed preferences for a White cartoon child over a Black cartoon child but reversed these pref erences afer hearing a story featuring a Black child as a hero (Jordan & Hernandez-Reif,2009). Fitting the developmental milestones described at the outset, it appears that Black preschool children may not yet value race over narrative. In a 1996 survey of 108 Black adolescents concerning their TV viewing habits, TV role models, and career aspirations,participants tended to identify Black role models as their favorite TV characters. How ever, their overall amount of TV viewing did not infuence participants’ perceived ability to achieve their career aspirations. In a 2004 study, 156 Black high school students were surveyed concerning their TV viewing amounts, identifcation with 20 popular Black and White TV characters, and self-esteem. Stronger identifcation with Black characters predicted higher self-esteem, and stronger identifcation with White characters pre dicted lower self-esteem. Together, these fndings indicate that viewer age and race of portrayals matter, and that older Black youth are more likely drawn to and infuenced by Black media characters, and ofen in a positive way.

  

#### Findings among other ethnic/racial minority youth

  

Relative to Black youth, much less is known about how media exposure contributes to the developmental outcomes of other ethnic/racial minority youth in the United States (i.e., American Indian, Latinx, Asian American, Middle Eastern), or of how expo sure to media stereotypes about their group informs youths’ feelings about themselves.Although much more research is needed, the fndings from extant literature are con sistent: greater exposure to mainstream media and their limited portrayals is generally associated with poorer psychosocial adjustment among ethnic/racial minority youth.

  

#### American Indian youth

  

American Indians are largely misrepresented in mainstream media (for review, see Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013; Mastro, 2017), and are ofen stereotyped as people who are drug addicts, alcoholics, and prone to suicide and depression. How do these constrained images afect the development of American Indian youth? In a series of studies with American Indian adolescents and college students, researchers found that exposure to American Indian mascots (i.e., Chief Wahoo and Pocahontas) resulted in depressed state self-esteem, even though it was determined that American Indian

  

youth deemed these mascots as positive. Indeed, high school youth who were exposed to Chief Wahoo and Pocahontas images in the positive stereotype condition reported lower self-esteem than those who were exposed to text citing studies of American Indian high school dropout, suicide, and alcoholism rates. A follow-up study with another group of high school students showed that exposure to the same mascots and negative stereotyping condition about American Indians led to depressed community worth relative to the control condition. In the same vein, researchers found that college students who were exposed to Chief Wahoo and Pocahontas generated fewer achievement-related selves relative to those who were exposed to a college fund adver tisement featuring an American Indian young woman. Together, the results suggest that although American Indian mascots may be deemed “positive,” they are nonetheless stereotypes that may harm, rather than help, the development of a healthy self-concept.

  

### Latinx youth

  

As the largest and fastest growing ethnic/racial group in the United States (com prising 18% of the U.S. population), Latinxs are severely underrepresented in mainstream media, comprising just 2–5% of characters on primetime TV programing (Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013). Tese representations are limited both in number and in diversity, as Latinxs are typically sexualized and criminalized in mainstream media (Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013; Mastro, 2017). Focus group data reveal that Latinx youth are aware of the negative and stereotypical portrayals of their ethnic group on TV,have difculty identifying and ofering commentary on positive portrayals of Latinx people on TV, and ofen dissociate themselves from stereotypical representations. In addition, it appears that this media use is associated with acculturation, especially if the motivation to watch English language TV programs is to gain cultural information.

  

Despite the dearth of media research with Latinx youth, a handful of studies pro vide a preliminary understanding of Latinx youth development in the context of media (for a discussion of many of these studies, see Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013; Mastro,2017). One outcome studied has been self-esteem, and in particular, the link between TV exposure and self-esteem. In general, it appears that this link may depend on the type of self-esteem measured and the strength of one’s ethnic-racial identity (ERI).For example, among Latinx high school students, researchers found that greater con sumption of soap operas was associated with lower social self-esteem and a greater desire to change one’s physical appearance; however, primetime TV exposure was not related to performance or global self-esteem. Among a sample of Latinx college stu dents, researchers found a strong contribution of ERI, such that twice as many signif icant media correlates emerged for participants with a stronger ERI relative to those with a weaker ERI. In particular, for participants with stronger ERI, greater exposure to movies and primetime TV was associated with lower social and appearance self-esteem,among other outcomes. Teir fndings suggest that those who are especially proud of being Latinx may be more sensitive to the lack of (quality) media representations of Latinxs compared to those for whom their ethnicity/race is not a central part of their identity. Interestingly, although media use was associated with various psychosocial outcomes, there was no signifcant relation between media use and ERI.

  

### Asian American youth

  

Like other ethnic/racial minority groups in the United States, Asian Americans do not fare better in terms of the quantity and quality of their mainstream media repre sentations. Asian American women are typically sexualized, while men are depicted as asexual. A slightly more “positive” type of Asian American media representation is the model minority stereotype (Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013), which assumes that all Asian Americans are intelligent, hardworking, good at math and science,and shy and passive. Consistent with this stereotype, Asian Americans are frequently portrayed in ways that suggest their intelligence, academic and professional success,and reserved personality, and qualitative research suggests that Asian American youth feel constrained by the limitations of this media stereotype and seek out alternative forms of media (e.g., YouTube).

  

### Arab/Middle Eastern youth

  

A common image associated with Arabs/Middle Easterners is that of a terrorist (Behm-Morawitz & Ortiz, 2013), in part due to global and political events and news media coverage of terrorism. Such stigmatization is believed to have a detrimental toll on the mental health and academic performance of Muslim American youth, many of whom identify as Arab/Middle Eastern. However, we located no studies among Arab youth investigating contributions of media use to beliefs about their group.

  

### How does media use affect intergroup ethnic/racial attitudes among youth of color?

  

Although some have addressed this question using adult samples, to our knowledge,no published studies have explored the extent to which media shape ethnic/racial minority youths’ views of each other. However, two studies have examined how media use infuences Asian national adolescents’ views of African Americans. Tese studies have found that in general, Asian youth who watch more American media are more likely to evaluate African Americans negatively, particularly if the media stereotype is evaluated as a negative (Tan, Dalisay, Zhang, Han, & Merchant, 2010; Tan, Zhang,Zhang, & Dalisay, 2009). In their cross-sectional study, Tan and colleagues (2009)found that Chinese adolescents who consumed more American movies were more likely to believe that African Americans were violent. Similarly, Chinese youth who read more American books were more likely to believe that African Americans were less polite. Tose who watched more DVD movies tended to believe that African Americans were arrogant, and those who watched more American TV were more likely to believe that African Americans were greedy and unintelligent. However,Chinese youth who consumed more Chinese media were more likely to believe that African Americans are honest, moral, and open-minded; in particular, older youth were more likely to use Chinese media to learn more about Americans, and thus had more positive evaluations of African Americans.

  

Similarly, Tan et al. (2010) found that exposure to media portrayals of African Amer icans is linked to South Korean youths’ perceptions of African Americans. However,whether these youth evaluated African Americans positively or negatively depended upon their perceptions of the media portrayal as positive or negative. Portrayals per ceived to be positive and realistic led to positive stereotyping of African Americans,whereas portrayals perceived to be negative and realistic led to negative stereotyping.Tese fndings suggest that the development of ethnic/racial stereotypes may depend upon whether the media portrayal is perceived to be positive or negative. It is impor tant to note that although Asian national and Asian American youth share common ancestry, their race perceptions cannot be considered one and the same.

  

## Conclusion

  

Although media use is a dominant part of the lives of youth around the world, we still know very little of how this socialization force contributes to their beliefs about race/ethnicity and their own racial/ethnic identities. Instead of outlining specifc sug gestions for future research, more research of any kind to help build a knowledge base in this feld is called for. For example, survey and longitudinal research that links every day media use to beliefs about race held by POC and White youth; experimental studies that test the assumptions and preferences that may result from exposure to stereotypi cal and multidimensional portrayals; and research across diferent media, including the understudied domains of flm, video games, and social media. Finally, developmental work that compares how youth of diferent ages respond to and are afected by the same racial media content is called for. How do efects change with developmental stage?What other individual diference factors, including gender, ERI, pubertal status, and religiosity, moderate the efects demonstrated? At this point, answers to these and other relevant questions are on hold until more research has been amassed in this feld.
