## Media Use and the Development of Racial and Ethnic Attitudes and Stereotypes

Understanding how youth learn about race in a multiracial society involves multiple belief types (stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination) and diverse influences (internal cognitive growth, external factors like parents, peers, teachers, and media). Children’s racial attitudes develop early, shaped by what they see, hear, and learn—and media is a powerful, persistent source of examples and storylines. Existing research has often focused on adults or media content itself. In contrast, here the emphasis is on how media use influences the formation of racial and ethnic beliefs among youth under 18, particularly in the United States since 1995. Key areas include: theoretical frameworks, developmental milestones in racial awareness, media’s effects on White youth’s views of people of color (POC), media’s effects on POC youth’s perceptions of themselves, and how POC youth may view other minority groups.

## Theoretical perspectives on how children develop racial attitudes and stereotypes
Several frameworks explain how children’s racial attitudes form:

- **[Social learning](Definitions/theories/Social%20cognitive%20(learning)%20theory%20(Bandura).md) approaches:** Children observe and imitate the people around them—this includes not only family and peers but also media figures.  
- **Cognitive developmental theories:** As children mature, they develop categorization skills and the ability to understand multiple group traits. Younger kids rely on surface traits (e.g., skin color), while older ones recognize internal complexities and exceptions.  
- **Developmental intergroup theory (DIT):** Children focus on attributes deemed important by their environment. Race becomes salient if society frequently labels and treats groups differently. The result: Children hypothesize stereotypes about these groups’ differences.

**Media’s role:** Media often highlight certain features of specific racial groups, making those aspects chronically accessible. Cultivation theory suggests repeated exposure to certain depictions can shape parallel beliefs in viewers, while [social cognitive theory](Definitions/theories/Social%20cognitive%20(learning)%20theory%20(Bandura).md) underscores identification with, and learning from, media models’ rewarded or punished behaviors.

## Developmental milestones in children’s understanding of racial categories
Racial sensitivity appears in [infancy](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md). By around 3–6 months, some [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) prefer faces of their own race (?), suggesting early perceptual discrimination. By preschool (ages 3–6), children notice racial-ethnic differences, often relying on external features. Majority-group children commonly show in-group favoritism, while minority-group children may show mixed preferences.

In [middle childhood](Definitions/Age%20ranges/middle%20childhood.md) (6–10), children’s thinking becomes more flexible. They understand more subtle traits and see individuals within a group as varied, reducing overt bias. By ages 10–14, they grasp broader social complexities, such as socioeconomic differences tied to race. During [adolescence](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md), youth actively form their own ethnic/racial identities.

### Does media use affect White youth’s views of POC?
Research on direct media effects on White children’s racial attitudes is limited but insightful:

- **Nonverbal cues:** Studies show that White children exposed to positive nonverbal signals in interracial encounters rate Black individuals more favorably. Yet, efforts to improve White youth’s attitudes via heroic Black characters may not always overcome pre-existing biases.
- **Counter-examples:** Exposure to political rap music led White high schoolers to favor a liberal Black candidate over a liberal White one, demonstrating that certain media can prompt more positive outgroup evaluations.
- **Social media & gaming:** One study linked White youth’s video game use to higher racial resentment, though Facebook/Twitter use showed no direct link. This suggests certain media formats may be more influential than others.

### Interventions for prejudice reduction
Some interventions using pro-diversity content have been tested:

- **Pro-diversity TV programs:** For very young White children, brief exposure to multicultural content didn’t significantly alter racial preferences. Even repeated exposure often failed.
- **Parent involvement:** When parents discussed diverse video content with their White children, outgroup attitudes improved, but videos alone or discussions alone were more effective than both combined (?), suggesting a nuanced interplay between media messages and parental guidance.
  
> [!info]+ Note on Storybooks  
> Extended contact theory suggests that reading stories about intergroup friendships can improve children’s attitudes. Studies with British and Italian youth found that reading about diverse friendships improved opinions about immigrants. High identification with certain heroes, like Harry Potter, also fostered acceptance.

> Such positive shifts seem strongest when youth strongly identify with ingroup characters or have limited direct cross-group experiences.

### Does media use affect minority youth’s views of themselves?
For youth of color, media portrayals can influence self-perception and academic self-concept, often in negative ways due to stereotypical depictions.

#### Findings among Black youth
- **Negative academic self-view:** Black boys exposed to rap videos (violent or not) felt more materialistic and doubted that a Black man could finish law school. Black [adolescents](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md) watching many Black sitcoms rated themselves as less capable in science.
- **Gendered racial stereotypes:** Heavier viewing of Black-oriented TV shows was linked to Black youth’s stronger endorsement of the “strong Black woman” stereotype.
- **Identification matters:** Younger Black children sometimes prefer White cartoon characters initially but can shift after pro-Black narratives. Older Black teens identifying strongly with Black media characters often report higher self-esteem, while identifying with White characters predicts lower self-esteem. This underscores developmental stage and character race importance.

#### Findings among other ethnic/racial minority youth
Far fewer studies address Latino, Asian American, American Indian, or Arab/Middle Eastern youth. Existing evidence suggests limited, stereotyped portrayals harm self-esteem and sense of belonging.

> [!info]+ American Indian Youth  
> Exposure to so-called “positive” American Indian mascots lowered self-esteem more than exposure to negative real-world statistics about their community, showing that even “positive” stereotypes are harmful.  
  
> [!info]+ Latinx Youth and ERI  
> Latinx youth aware of stereotypical sexualized or criminal portrayals may feel more distant from these depictions. For those with a strong ethnic-racial identity (ERI), heavy media use correlates with lower social or appearance self-esteem. Teens proud of their identity may be more sensitive to poor representation.  
  
> [!info]+ Asian American Youth and “Model Minority” Stereotype  
> Asian American portrayals often push the “model minority” trope. Though seemingly positive, it still restricts individuality. Youth may feel trapped by expectations of academic perfection and passivity. Limited research exists, but qualitative work suggests Asian American youth seek alternative media (e.g., online) to escape these constraints.

> [!info]+ Arab/Middle Eastern Youth?  
> Little direct research. Common terrorist stereotypes likely impact mental health and academic outcomes negatively, but studies are lacking.

### How does media use affect intergroup ethnic/racial attitudes among youth of color?
There’s almost no research on how POC youth’s media use shapes their views of other minority groups. Some studies in Asia found that Chinese and Korean [adolescents](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md) who consumed more U.S. media often adopt negative stereotypes of African Americans. However, if the portrayals are seen as positive and realistic, they may yield more favorable impressions. Older Chinese youth who used Chinese media to learn about Americans showed more positive views of Black Americans, suggesting the perceived valence of portrayals critically matters.

## Conclusion
Media are a central feature of young people’s environments, yet we know shockingly little about how these portrayals shape children’s racial attitudes and ethnic identities. More research is urgently needed:

- **Surveys and longitudinal studies:** Link everyday viewing with evolving beliefs in both White and POC youth.
- **Experiments:** Test how stereotypical vs. nuanced depictions alter assumptions and preferences.
- **Media forms:** Explore films, video games, and social media—largely understudied areas.
- **Developmental comparisons:** Examine how youth at different ages, with different identities and backgrounds, respond to the same portrayals. Who is most affected and why?

Ultimately, the complexity of racial socialization calls for more nuanced, interdisciplinary research to inform media producers, parents, educators, and policymakers on how to leverage media for reducing stereotypes and fostering healthier racial attitudes.
