## A LETTER FROM OUR FOUNDER
Media is a powerful social force that can either cement harmful stereotypes or serve as a gateway to understanding and inclusion. Two decades ago, Common Sense was founded on the principle that media could improve lives by providing more truthful, empathetic, and empowering stories—especially for children growing up in a diverse world. The research summarized here represents a step toward identifying how far we’ve come and how far we still must go in achieving equitable, inclusive media.

Today’s media generally overrepresent White characters and narratives, often leaving people of color (POC) underrepresented or stereotypically portrayed. While some progress has been made, parents still struggle to find content that meaningfully and positively represents various ethnic-racial identities. Surveys of parents show they believe media strongly influences how their children view themselves and others, highlighting the urgent need for content that genuinely reflects racial and cultural diversity, and not just token appearances.

> [!info]+ Key Insight: Parents’ Demands  
> Parents want high-quality media that shows nonstereotypical, aspirational, and culturally rich portrayals of diverse characters. They see media as a tool to teach empathy, respect, and acceptance. When parents’ needs align with industry production, media can become an avenue for justice and celebration of differences.

Common Sense aims to integrate these research insights into their ratings and reviews, guiding parents toward content that fosters inclusive ethnic-racial development (ERD). This also challenges content creators to bring forth varied, accurate portrayals and elevate diverse voices behind the camera. Our hope is that this encourages media to be a force for good, helping all kids feel valued and celebrated for who they are.

## PART I—Why Media Representation Matters for Kids' Ethnic-Racial Development

### Key Findings
- **ERD matters:** Kids’ ethnic-racial development (ERD) shapes how they see their own ethnicity-race and others’. Understanding ERD stages helps identify where media can either disrupt harmful messages or reinforce them.
- **Negative self-impact:** Exposure to negative ethnic-racial portrayals can lower self-esteem, academic confidence, and group pride among youth of color.
- **Positive influence:** Favorable, multifaceted portrayals of a child’s ethnic-racial group can boost self-worth and pride.
- **Stereotypes harm intergroup attitudes:** Biased images of POC can encourage fear, suspicion, and prejudiced policy support among White viewers.
- **Under- and misrepresentation:** POC characters are often absent or pigeonholed into stereotypes. Latinos, Native Americans, and Middle Eastern groups are notably missing or simplified in media narratives, distorting children’s sense of who matters.
- **Overrepresentation of White roles:** White actors dominate leads and central storylines, reinforcing an inaccurate social hierarchy.
- **Potential for positive change:** High-quality children’s media can shape more inclusive attitudes, if it commits to nuanced, respectful portrayals.
- **Early awareness:** Even very young kids notice race. Inclusive media from infancy onwards can influence ERD in positive ways.

### Introduction
Media can be a mirror or a distorter. Historically, it has often been the latter for communities of color. The potential impact of these portrayals on children’s ERD is enormous. ERD includes how children perceive their own group and others, form stereotypes, and understand racism. While research on these topics is limited, what we have shows patterns that demand attention.

> [!info]- Limited but Growing Evidence  
> Although ERD and media effects research is sparse, emerging studies highlight the need to fill these gaps. As media evolves—more streaming, user-generated content—research must keep pace to understand their role in shaping racial attitudes.

### Ethnicity-Race and Why It Matters
Race is a social construct used to categorize people based on physical appearance and assign them hierarchical status. In the U.S., whiteness is privileged and other “non-White” identities are marginalized. Ethnicity involves shared culture and history; race and ethnicity often overlap because ethnic groups are racialized.

These constructs carry real social and psychological weight. They influence how society treats different groups and, thus, how children learn who is valued and who is not.

### Children’s Ethnic-Racial Development
**Five Dimensions of ERD:**
1. **Awareness:** Recognizing phenotypic (skin color) differences and group visibility.
2. **Self-related processes:** Feelings about one’s own ethnic-racial group and identity.
3. **Other-related processes:** Categorizing, evaluating, and forming attitudes about other groups.
4. **Knowledge:** Learning cultural histories, stereotypes, and understanding complexity.
5. **Racism:** Awareness of systemic inequalities and consequences of racism.

> [!info]+ Age Matters  
> As children grow, their understanding of race and ethnicity becomes more sophisticated. Infants notice faces; preschoolers start forming group preferences; by middle childhood, they understand complex social realities; in adolescence, they shape their ethnic-racial identity and question systemic inequalities.

### Developmental Milestones
- **Infants (0–2):** Notice racial faces; form preferences based on familiar cues. Not inherently biased, but environment shapes comfort and recognition.
- **Early Childhood (3–6):** Identify visible race-related features, may show in-group favoritism or internalize racial hierarchies. Stereotypes form but are simplistic and literal.
- **Middle Childhood (7–11):** More nuanced views; kids recognize that race can define opportunities. They learn that openly talking about race is taboo but have growing historical and cultural knowledge.
- **Young Teens (12–14):** Intensified focus on identity; greater social complexity. They see overlapping dimensions (gender, class, etc.) and have clearer perceptions of inequality.
- **Late Teens (15–18):** Deepening critical understanding. Youth of color often become keenly aware of discrimination and racism, while some White youth start recognizing their own privilege.

## Ethnic-Racial Presentation in Media and Effects on Ethnic and Racial Processes
Media can teach kids about ethnicity and race, both explicitly and implicitly. Persistent patterns of absence, stereotype, and tokenism shape their understanding:

- **Awareness in Media:** Consistent overrepresentation of White characters and underrepresentation of others signals who “belongs” and who is marginal. Even children’s shows echo these patterns.  
- **Self-related Processes:** Youth of color exposed to negative media images may feel worse about themselves and their communities. Positive portrayals can counter these effects.  
- **Other-related Processes & Knowledge:** White-dominant portrayals and stereotypes can lead White children to adopt harmful biases and dread interracial contact. Alternatively, if media shows cooperation, empathy, and respectful representation, it can foster positive attitudes.  
- **Racism Understanding:** Media can legitimize or challenge racist norms. Historically biased depictions (e.g., stereotyped roles for POC) reinforce harmful worldviews, but inclusive, honest storytelling can encourage critical thinking about inequities.

> [!info]+ Media as Catalyst  
> Programs like Sesame Street have shown that positive, inclusive portrayals can encourage pro-social and anti-bias attitudes. This potential exists across all media, but requires intention.

## Guidance and Considerations
**For Parents, Educators, and Content Developers:**

1. **Diversity, Equity, Inclusion:**  
   - Seek and create media that features a broad range of characters, cultures, and stories.  
   - Move beyond tokenism; show depth and variety within ethnic groups.  
   - Offer counter-stereotypical examples (e.g., female Black scientist, Latino CEO, Native American lead character in a modern setting).

2. **Ethnic-Racial Socialization Through Media:**  
   - Use storylines as conversation starters to discuss race and culture.  
   - Don’t avoid talking about race; avoidance can perpetuate ignorance.  
   - Introduce appropriate terminology and historical/cultural context.

3. **Language Usage:**  
   - Be mindful of generalizations. Describe actions, not fixed traits.  
   - Provide accurate ethnic-racial labels and correct stereotypes.  
   - Use language that affirms complexity and avoids essentializing entire groups.

> [!tip]+ Positive Media Use Strategies  
> - Curate content showing diverse friendships and problem-solving.  
> - After watching, talk with kids about what they saw, emphasizing complexity and refuting stereotypes.  
> - Highlight positive role models from various backgrounds.

## Concluding Thoughts
Media is a crucial influence on children’s understanding of race. As kids evolve from infancy through adolescence, their grasp of ethnicity-race deepens. Parents know media matters: They want empowering, honest, diverse content. Yet research on how media shapes ERD is limited, especially for newer platforms like social media and video games.

> [!info]- Research Gaps  
> More evidence is needed on the ERD impact of films, user-generated content, and interactive platforms. Also lacking are studies on how intersectional identities affect children’s media reception (e.g., race plus gender, class, ability).

In short, media holds both promise and peril. With careful, research-informed approaches, creators can support children’s ERD positively. By embracing complexity, acknowledging past and present injustices, and presenting authentic stories, media can guide children toward a more empathetic, inclusive worldview.

## ETHNIC-RACIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MEDIA EXPOSURE BY AGE
(See tables in the original text for detailed age-wise breakdowns.)

From infancy’s awareness of faces to adolescence’s understanding of structural racism, children at all ages benefit from media that respects their intellectual and emotional capacities. Media that encourages conversations, shows multifaceted POC characters, and reveals both historical truths and present inequalities can help children navigate the complex terrain of race. Conversely, media that relies on stereotypes or erases entire groups impedes ERD.

> [!info]- Age-Specific Recommendations  
> - Infants/Toddlers: Offer diverse, positive images.  
> - Preschoolers: Show characters from multiple backgrounds cooperating and celebrating differences.  
> - Middle Childhood: Include nuanced stories, historical context, and role models challenging stereotypes.  
> - Adolescents: Engage with deeper content—discussions about racism, intersectionality, and civic responsibility.

## PART II—What Parents Think About Diverse Representations in Kids' Media
A separate survey asked 1,143 U.S. parents of children ages 2–12 about their views on diversity in media. Key findings:

- **Parents value representation:** They want media that teaches acceptance (over 80%), shows cultures different from their own (74%), and reflects their own communities (70%).
- **Gaps persist:** Many parents of color feel their groups are underrepresented or stereotyped. About one-third of Asian, Black, and Hispanic/Latino parents say there aren’t enough characters like their children.
- **Influence on attitudes:** Two-thirds believe media influences how their kids treat others and what they know about race and culture. Parents want more positive role models and nuanced portrayals.
- **Positive examples cited:** Parents praised Sesame Street, Dora the Explorer, and others for positive portrayals. They criticized YouTube and some adult-oriented shows for negative stereotypes.
- **Parents want media that embraces complexity:** They see media as a way to inspire career aspirations, teach empathy, and broaden horizons.

> [!info]+ Parent Requests  
> Parents call for authenticity, respectful portrayal of BIPOC communities, recognition of cultural depth, and the dismantling of “one-note” stereotypes.

In conclusion, parents know media matters and want more. They desire stories that celebrate diversity, nurture empathy, correct misrepresentations, and encourage children to view all ethnic-racial groups with respect and acceptance.
