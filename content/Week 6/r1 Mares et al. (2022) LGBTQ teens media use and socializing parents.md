# Mutual Influence in LGBTQ Teens’ Use of Media to Socialize Their Parents

Parents and children mutually influence each other’s views and behaviors, including how they interact with media. For LGBTQ teens, media can be a powerful tool for shaping their parents’ understanding and acceptance of their sexual or gender identities. This research explores how LGBTQ [adolescents](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md) use TV shows, movies, and other media content that features LGBTQ narratives to educate, inform, and influence their parents, and how these efforts relate to teens’ perceptions of parental support and their own mental health.

## Background and Motivation
Traditional socialization models often emphasize a top-down flow of influence from parents to children. However, newer theories, like social relational theory, argue that influence flows in both directions. Children can also impact their parents’ attitudes and behaviors. This mutual influence is especially relevant in domains where the child may hold unique expertise or experience—such as an LGBTQ teen educating their parents about their identity.

When it comes to LGBTQ youth, media offers rich material to spark conversation. Teens may highlight positive representations of LGBTQ characters, discourage harmful portrayals, or use on-screen scenarios as jumping-off points for discussing their own experiences. Understanding these media-centered interactions can shed light on how teens shape family dynamics and gain parental support for their identities.

## Two Studies With LGBTQ 18- and 19-Year-Olds
To investigate these possibilities, two separate surveys of LGBTQ older teens (18–19) in the U.S. were conducted. Study 1 recruited participants via MTurk, and Study 2 recruited via Qualtrics online panels. Both studies asked participants to identify their LGBTQ identities, pick their more supportive parent to focus on, and report how often they co-viewed LGBTQ media content, encouraged their parent to watch positive LGBTQ representations, discouraged them from watching negative ones, explained or critiqued LGBTQ portrayals, and engaged in identity-related discussions inspired by media.

Participants also rated how receptive their parents were to these media-based interactions, whether they felt their parents supported their LGBTQ identity, and their own mental health indicators like self-esteem and depressive symptoms. The goal was to see if LGBTQ teens’ use of media to “socialize up” influenced their family relationships, as well as how parent support related to the teen’s wellbeing.

> [!info]+ Why Focus on Media?
> Media representations can serve as relatable examples or conversation starters. For LGBTQ teens, a TV show with a well-rounded gay character or a transgender storyline can illustrate lived experiences, helping parents grasp what their child’s identity means.  
> Teens may say: “See that character’s supportive family? That’s what I hope for.” Or “This storyline is hurtful, and I don’t want you to think of me that way.”

## Key Research Questions
1. **Frequency of LGBTQ-Media-Related Behaviors (RQ1):** How often do LGBTQ teens co-view LGBTQ-inclusive media with their parents, encourage or discourage certain content, critique portrayals, and discuss their own identity as prompted by media?
2. **Parental Responses (H2, RQ2):** How receptive are parents to these media-related interventions? Are parents generally more open to positive engagement like co-viewing and encouragement, and more resistant to being restricted or corrected?
3. **Predictors of Media-Related Behaviors (H1):** Are teens who see their parents as more supportive, and who feel more certain about their own LGBTQ identity, more likely to engage in these media-related behaviors?
4. **Perceptions of Identity Support (H3):** Do teens who engage in more of these behaviors, and who perceive parents as more receptive, feel more supported by their parents regarding their LGBTQ identity?
5. **Mental Health Outcomes (H4, H5):** Does feeling supported in one’s LGBTQ identity, and perceiving parents as receptive, relate to better mental health (higher self-esteem, fewer depressive symptoms), beyond general parental supportiveness?

## What Was Measured
- **LGBTQ-Media Behaviors:** Five core behaviors:
  - **Co-Viewing:** Watching LGBTQ-inclusive content together.
  - **Encouraging Exposure:** Urging parents to watch positive LGBTQ portrayals.
  - **Restrictive Mediation:** Discouraging parents from watching negative LGBTQ portrayals.
  - **Active Mediation:** Critiquing, explaining, or clarifying problematic or nuanced portrayals.
  - **Media-Inspired Talk:** Using media as a springboard to discuss the teen’s own LGBTQ identity.
  
- **Parental Receptivity:** Teens rated how positively or negatively they thought their parents responded (or would respond) to these behaviors.

- **Parent Supportiveness:** Teens first rated how supportive parents are in general, then how specifically supportive they are of the teen’s LGBTQ identity.

- **Identity Uncertainty:** How unsure teens felt about their LGBTQ identity.

- **Mental Health:** Teens rated self-esteem and depressive symptoms.

> [!info]- Outness and Timing
> Teens reported these behaviors happening at various stages—before they even fully realized their identity, while considering coming out, during the coming-out process, or after coming out. Media-based influence doesn’t rely solely on “after I’ve told my parents who I am.” It can be an exploratory tool before full disclosure.

## Main Findings

### LGBTQ-Media-Related Behaviors Are Common
Both studies found that LGBTQ teens frequently use media in this way. Many had tried to influence their parents’ media consumption, from encouraging them to watch shows with positive LGBTQ characters to discussing how certain representations matched or diverged from their own experiences.

- In Study 1, around 60–70% had done at least one of these behaviors.  
- In Study 2, about 33–53% frequently engaged in these behaviors.  
- Only a tiny fraction never attempted any such mediation.

Encouraging parents to watch positive LGBTQ content was the most common behavior. Teens also often co-viewed LGBTQ media, explained or critiqued portrayals, and sparked identity-related discussions. Restrictive mediation (telling parents not to watch negative content) was slightly less common but still prevalent.

> [!info]+ Teens’ Voices
> Some teens loved watching shows like “Glee” or “Brooklyn 99” with their parents, using the characters to say, “Here’s someone like me, living a good life.” Others pointed out harmful stereotypes in shows and asked parents to avoid them.  
> One teen explained that seeing a lesbian character in a show helped open conversations about their own identity, while another tried to discourage a parent from watching a show with insensitive trans portrayals.

### Parents’ Responses Vary Widely
Teens’ perceptions of parental receptivity ranged from enthusiastic acceptance to hostile rejection. Some parents seemed eager to engage and learn. Others reacted negatively, maybe skipping scenes with LGBTQ characters or dismissing the teen’s comments.

- Roughly a third of teens in Study 2 reported negative parental reactions, another third positive, and the rest neutral.
- Contrary to the initial hypothesis (H2), parents were not clearly more receptive to encouragement and co-viewing than to restrictive or critical interventions. Parents reacted variably to all these behaviors.

> [!warning]- Risky Conversations
> One teen wrote about encouraging a parent to watch a show with a bisexual character, only to have the parent shut down or refuse to engage. Another tried to show their mom a coming-out video on YouTube and initially got a positive reaction, but the mom eventually turned it into a religious condemnation, derailing the conversation.

### Predictors of Media-Related Behaviors
As expected, teens who perceived their parents as more generally supportive tended to engage more in these media-based efforts. If a parent seemed trustworthy and caring, teens felt safer bringing LGBTQ media into the family space and using it as a conduit for identity discussions.

Identity uncertainty did not have a consistent relationship with media behaviors. In one study, uncertain teens were even more likely to engage, possibly seeking clarity and support. In the other study, identity uncertainty was unrelated. More research is needed.

### Building Identity Support
Both studies confirmed that teens who more frequently co-viewed or mediated LGBTQ content, and who perceived their parents as receptive, felt more supported by their parents regarding their LGBTQ identity. This aligns with arguments that positive shared media experiences can foster understanding, empathy, and support.

Even after controlling for how supportive parents were in general, these media-specific interactions and the perceived quality of these interactions stood out as uniquely linked to feeling supported in one’s LGBTQ identity.

> [!info]+ Beyond General Niceness
> A parent can be generally kind, but if they reject or diminish LGBTQ media moments, a teen might not feel truly understood as an LGBTQ individual. Conversely, a parent who’s somewhat distant but thoughtfully engages with LGBTQ storylines might communicate that the teen’s identity matters and deserves support.

### Mental Health Implications
High levels of parental support for a child’s LGBTQ identity have long been associated with better mental health. Here, the studies looked at whether media-based interactions and parental receptivity predicted self-esteem and depressive symptoms, above and beyond general support.

- Study 1: Teens who perceived their parents as receptive to these media-based conversations reported higher self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms.
- Study 2: Teens who felt their parents supported their LGBTQ identity reported higher self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms, but parental receptivity was not strongly linked this time.

These findings emphasize that both general and identity-specific support from parents can be crucial for LGBTQ teens’ mental health. The exact nature of this relationship may vary depending on the individual or the stage of their identity development.

> [!tip]+ Reinforcing Positive Cycles
> Supportive media interactions may create a positive feedback loop. Teens share LGBTQ content → Parents respond with interest → Teens feel supported → Teens have higher self-esteem and fewer depressive symptoms → Teens feel more comfortable continuing these conversations.

## Inconsistencies and Future Directions
While the broad patterns were replicated, some differences emerged between the two studies, possibly due to sample differences or measurement complexities. Study 2 participants were predominantly cisgender females and more likely bisexual, which might affect generalizability.

More research is needed to:
- Include both teens and parents to see how parents perceive these interactions.
- Conduct longitudinal studies or moment-to-moment assessments to capture reciprocal influence over time.
- Explore different contexts (younger [adolescents](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md), non-U.S. cultures, various family structures).
- Investigate how these processes unfold with other aspects of identity (e.g., disability, political views, religion).

## Conclusion
LGBTQ teens actively use media to shape their parents’ understanding and acceptance of their identities. These media-based tactics—co-viewing LGBTQ-inclusive shows, encouraging or discouraging certain content, explaining portrayals, and sparking identity-related discussions—can influence how supported teens feel in their LGBTQ identity.

Perceived parental receptivity to these interactions matters. When parents respond positively, teens are more likely to feel validated and supported as LGBTQ individuals. This sense of support, in turn, can have positive implications for their mental health.

In short, media serves not just as entertainment but as a site of negotiation, education, and mutual influence in families navigating the complexities of LGBTQ identity acceptance. By recognizing and fostering these constructive media engagements, families, educators, and therapists might find new pathways for building understanding and support during a critical phase of a young person’s life.

> [!info]- Takeaways for Families
> **For Parents:** Even if LGBTQ themes feel unfamiliar, watching and discussing them with your teen can show you care about their perspective. Acknowledge what you don’t know, listen to their insights, and consider their recommendations.  
> **For Teens:** Sharing a heartfelt show or a respectful depiction of an LGBTQ character can open conversations. Tailor your choices—pick content that genuinely resonates with your experiences and might connect with your parent’s values.  
> **For Support Networks:** Counselors and youth workers can encourage families to find and discuss LGBTQ-positive media. These “media moments” can bridge gaps, clarify misconceptions, and strengthen bonds.
