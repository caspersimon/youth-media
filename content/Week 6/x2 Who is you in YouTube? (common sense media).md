## Who Is the “You” in YouTube? Missed Opportunities in Race and Representation in Children’s YouTube Videos

This report examines how children’s and teens’ YouTube viewing relates to ethnic-racial representation in online videos—a critical dimension often overlooked, even as online video consumption skyrockets. YouTube, a platform dominated by user-generated content, holds potential to broaden and diversify ethnic-racial portrayals. Instead, research conducted by Common Sense in partnership with the University of Michigan reveals that children’s YouTube experiences overwhelmingly mirror biases and racial hierarchies seen in traditional media. The analysis is based on samples of YouTube videos actually watched by two groups: children 0 to 8 and tweens/teens 9 to 18. While kids and teens now watch more YouTube than ever before, the platform is missing an opportunity to deliver authentic and inclusive storytelling. Instead, BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) characters remain underrepresented, stereotyped, or absent. These findings raise concern, given that research shows media representations shape youth’s ethnic-racial development (ERD), influencing how they perceive themselves and others.

## Introduction
In a few short years, YouTube has become a central media source for kids of all ages. For younger children, viewing time on user-generated platforms surpasses traditional TV. Teens now call YouTube their “can’t live without” service. Yet despite this influence, we know little about how YouTube’s vast library reflects or distorts the racial and cultural realities children face, and how it might affect their emerging understanding of ethnic-racial identities (ERD).

**ERD** encompasses how kids form awareness, attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions related to their own and others’ ethnic-racial backgrounds. Prior research shows that stereotyped or negative portrayals of a child’s ethnic group can harm self-esteem, academic aspirations, and future outlook. In contrast, positive, multidimensional portrayals can bolster pride and a sense of possibility.

YouTube could be a game-changer because it’s free, global, and user-driven, potentially empowering BIPOC creators who have historically been marginalized. Yet this report’s findings suggest YouTube falls short. Content often features White characters predominantly, while BIPOC characters remain relegated to token or stereotypical roles. Rarely do we see nuanced, culturally rich stories—just as rarely do we see explicit teaching about race, leaving many opportunities untapped.

> [!info]+ ERD and Media Basics  
> - Children start noticing racial differences in infancy and form basic attitudes by preschool.  
> - Media is a major source of racial "cues" shaping beliefs and biases.  
> - Rich, diverse portrayals can support healthy ERD; negative or shallow depictions may stunt or distort it.

## Key Findings
### For Children 0 to 8
- **Limited Diversity:** 62% of videos contained no BIPOC characters, and many relied on “colorblind” animals or fantasy creatures, missing a chance to portray real ethnic diversity.  
- **Underrepresentation:** Where BIPOC characters did appear, they were often token or background figures. Overall portrayal skewed heavily White.  
- **Negative Associations:** Videos with prominent BIPOC characters were more likely to feature violence (27% vs. 16% for videos with White characters), bad language (32% vs. 13%), and less educational content.  
- **Rare Depth:** Only 29% of videos offered fully developed BIPOC characters; 10% included stereotypes, often subtle. No videos actively taught about race or ethnicity. Instead, BIPOC presence often felt shallow—fewer well-rounded positive leads or complex storylines showcasing ethnic-racial diversity.

### For Tweens/Teens 9 to 18
- **More BIPOC Visibility, Still White-Dominated:** 61% of videos had any BIPOC individuals, more than in the younger sample, yet still 67% of characters were White. Groups like Latino, Native American, Middle Eastern, and others remained severely underrepresented.  
- **Stereotypes and Biases:** About 9% of videos featured explicit ethnic-racial stereotypes, meaning a teen watching 10 videos daily could see over 300 stereotyped portrayals a year. Negative jokes, accent mockery, and the N-word were among the offenses.  
- **Gender and Race Linked:** When ethnic-racial stereotypes were present, gender stereotypes often appeared too. Over half of stereotyped videos also included gender biases, such as hypersexualizing women of color.  
- **Limited Counterexamples:** Teens sometimes found BIPOC creators offering smart, positive role models, but these videos garnered fewer views compared to the highly viewed stereotypical content. Despite this, videos with stereotypes actually had fewer average views—suggesting viewers may prefer non-stereotypical content if given the choice.  
- **No Teaching Moments:** Only two videos (out of 1,242 across both samples) discussed race or ethnicity directly, both in the context of food culture. The platform misses a massive opportunity to foster critical thinking about race.

### Cross-Age Insights
- Both young children and teens watched content that overwhelmingly spotlighted White characters. For younger kids, BIPOC characters were rarely main leads. For older youth, representation improved slightly, and some teens sought creators from their own ethnic-racial groups.
- Negative portrayals and violence linked to BIPOC characters appeared more in the younger group’s videos, while stereotyping and subtle power imbalances appeared more in the teen group’s content—especially in gaming, vlogs, and compilations.
- Across ages, few videos challenged racism or explained cultural differences. The “teachable moment” potential in YouTube’s diverse library remained largely unrealized.

> [!info]- Implicit Bias  
> Children absorb subtle racial cues. With YouTube’s recommended feeds and engagement-driven metrics, certain biases may be inadvertently reinforced. Popular influencers may fall back on racial tropes for cheap laughs or sensationalism, normalizing these ideas for impressionable viewers.

## Methodology Overview
The sample included:
- **0 to 8**: 114 children’s viewing histories from March-April 2020. Five recently watched videos per child were coded (total 546 videos).
- **9 to 18**: 140 tweens/teens from June-July 2021. Five videos each, total 696 videos.

Coders trained in ethnic-racial media analysis identified characters, coded ethnic-racial groups, measured portrayal quality (positive, negative, shallow, stereotypes, or power imbalances), and recorded other features (violence, educational value, consumerism). Inter-rater reliability was high.

> [!info]+ Coding Ethnicity-Race  
> Because YouTube videos rarely specify ethnicity-race, coders used a consistent approach:  
> 1) Use self-disclosures by creators if available.  
> 2) Check external sources (e.g., known identity of popular YouTubers).  
> 3) Otherwise infer from contextual cues, though this is imperfect.

## Results for 0 to 8-Year-Olds

### Quantity and Type of Content
Young kids often watched “colorblind” cartoons (27%) or animal-based content. Half of these kids also viewed content with White dolls/avatars only. Many channels (like Cocomelon) highlight a mostly White family plus one token BIPOC child in the background.

### Representation and Portrayal
- Only 38% of videos had any BIPOC characters; 62% had none.
- Where BIPOC characters appeared, the portrayals often included higher rates of negative content: violence, bad language, and weaker educational value.
- Shallow portrayals were more common than explicit stereotypes. Still, 10% included some racial tropes—e.g., mocking accents in gaming videos, “White savior” narratives.

> [!info]- Why it Matters for Young Kids  
> Preschoolers form racial attitudes and can internalize bias. Without positive, diverse media role models, kids may learn to favor White characters as “normal” and devalue non-White identities. Missed chances at early cultural pride and empathy matter, as early ERD sets the stage for later identity and social behavior.

## Results for Tweens/Teens

### Genre and Engagement
Teens watch more user-generated, personality-driven content: vlogs (22%), gaming videos (16%), compilations (13%), music (12%). They seldom encountered language about race/ethnicity directly. Ethnic-racial stereotypes appeared in 9% of videos, raising concerns about normalization of bias. However, videos with stereotypes had fewer views, suggesting an appetite for better content.

### Portrayals and Patterns
- BIPOC leads were more common (35%) than in the younger sample, but White dominance persisted.
- Ethnic-racial stereotypes included racial slurs, mocking accents, or using dark skin to signal evil (e.g., horror characters).
- Ethnic-racial power imbalances often surfaced in reality-based content (court footage, policing videos), showing harsh treatment of BIPOC individuals by White authority figures.
- Gender stereotypes frequently co-occurred with racial stereotypes (55% vs. 18% in non-stereotyped videos), reinforcing that discrimination often clusters across identity axes.

> [!info]+ Why it Matters for Teens  
> As adolescents refine their ethnic-racial identities and moral compasses, exposure to both subtle and overt stereotypes can misguide them. Teens may admire YouTubers and internalize their jokes or assumptions as normative, shaping their future social attitudes and policies they support.

## Conclusions
YouTube’s platform advantages (user-generated, global reach) could revolutionize ethnic-racial representation by ampli-fying creators who reflect the U.S. and global demographic reality. Instead, children’s YouTube diets mostly resemble old patterns: White faces at the center, BIPOC characters either missing, tokenized, or stereotyped.

Few videos teach about race/ethnicity or highlight cultural pride. Negative stereotypes are still present in kids’ and teens’ feeds, sometimes concealed in humor or genre tropes. The minimal attempt to contextualize or challenge these messages leaves kids vulnerable to absorbing biases. If media is partly a teacher, YouTube has flunked the lesson in racial inclusivity and equity.

> [!warning]+ Algorithmic Risks  
> If engagement metrics reward extremity or simplistic humor, YouTube’s recommendations might elevate harmful stereotypes. Even if smaller creators produce positive content, their lower engagement numbers mean they get overshadowed by big channels leaning into clichés.

## Recommendations

### For Parents and Educators
- **Be mindful:** Guide kids toward channels that show robust, positive BIPOC characters.  
- **Watch together:** Discuss subtle stereotypes. Encourage kids to question why certain groups appear less or differently.  
- **Consider age-appropriate alternatives:** If YouTube’s main platform yields questionable content, try YouTube Kids or curated streaming options.

### For YouTube
- **Elevate BIPOC creators:** Intentionally promote underrepresented voices who produce culturally respectful content.  
- **Refine algorithms:** Penalize or demote videos using racist tropes; reward creators who challenge biases.  
- **Strengthen flagging policies:** Include subtle racial stereotypes as policy violations.  
- **Add editorial oversight:** Spot-check trending videos by human reviewers for biased content.

### For Content Creators
- **Foster authenticity:** Portray BIPOC characters as multidimensional leads, not stereotypes or sidekicks.  
- **No shortcuts:** Avoid cheap ethnic jokes or accent mockery. Rethink comedic tropes that lean on prejudice.  
- **Positive narratives:** Weave in cultural knowledge, pride, and historical context. Offer counter-stereotypes.  
- **Consult resources:** Understand ERD principles, reflect on potential biases in your work, and invest in diverse writers.

## Final Thoughts
As a platform, YouTube stands at a crossroads. Children rely on it for entertainment and learning. Will it become a source that broadens their cultural horizons, nurtures healthy ERD, and fosters global empathy? Or will it remain an echo chamber of old Hollywood norms?

With parent guidance, platform accountability, and crea-tors’ ethical storytelling, YouTube can uplift marginalized voices and correct the distortions of race so common in older media formats. The future is unwritten, but it can and should include everyone in honest, respectful ways.
