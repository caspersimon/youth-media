# A mixed-methods study of problematic social media use, attention dysregulation, and social media use motives

## Abstract
Problematic social media use (PSMU) refers to patterns of excessive and poorly controlled engagement with social platforms that disrupt daily functioning. Although often framed using addiction-based models, recent critiques argue that such measures may pathologize normal or context-dependent behavior. Self-regulatory abilities, especially around attention, are increasingly recognized as central to understanding who experiences social media use as “problematic.” This nested mixed-methods study combined survey-based statistical modeling with qualitative interviews to examine how attentional dysregulation (e.g., ADHD-like symptoms) and diverse social media use motives relate to PSMU.

Quantitatively, we found that attention dysregulation predicts elevated PSMU scores primarily through impulsive, habitual usage patterns, rather than simply through the amount of time spent online or general emotional wellbeing factors. Social connection motives actually reduced PSMU risk, suggesting that using platforms to maintain meaningful relationships may buffer against problematic patterns. Anxiety and depression (wellbeing indicators) were correlated with attention issues but played a limited direct role in predicting PSMU. Qualitatively, participants with attention dysregulation (regardless of whether they scored “high” or “low” on the BSMAS) described struggling to self-regulate their usage, often feeling “lost” in the feed despite conscious efforts to limit time online. They highlighted a rich tapestry of motives—seeking entertainment, information, human connection, and even emotional escape—many of which provided genuine value in their lives. These findings call into question the effectiveness of the BSMAS in fully capturing self-regulation challenges and contextualized motives, especially for individuals with attentional difficulties. Future research should incorporate nuanced measures of motivation, investigate self-regulation strategies, and consider the complexities of what constitutes “problematic” use.

> While PSMU is frequently conceptualized as a form of behavioral addiction, this study and others suggest that what looks like “addiction” may often reflect difficulties in self-regulation and attention management rather than an underlying disorder. Such reframing encourages looking beyond mere symptom checklists to understand the user’s goals, context, and internal control processes.

## Introduction
Over the past two decades, social media platforms have transformed communication, information-sharing, and entertainment. Emerging adults often engage with multiple platforms, spending hours each day online. Although many users benefit from social media (e.g., staying in contact with distant friends, accessing supportive communities, and learning new information), concerns persist about PSMU—patterns of use perceived as difficult to control, distracting, or detrimental to wellbeing.

However, large-scale research has begun to challenge the notion that high levels of social media use necessarily produce harm. Small effect sizes, contradictory findings, and the tendency to conflate heavy use with pathological use have prompted greater caution. Some argue that focusing narrowly on “addiction” draws attention away from key psychological processes like self-regulation. Instead of presuming that social media is inherently addictive, understanding how individual differences in attention and self-control shape usage patterns can clarify why some people struggle more than others.

> [!info]- A Nuanced View  
> Recent work suggests that negative impacts associated with social media are often overstated. When measurement tools treat heavy engagement as inherently pathological, they risk misinterpreting meaningful, purposeful uses as “problematic.” The challenge lies in distinguishing genuinely harmful patterns from ordinary, even beneficial engagement.

## Problematic Social Media Use
PSMU is frequently defined by excessive, involuntary use that interferes with daily life, leading to issues such as poorer sleep, academic difficulties, and mental health symptoms. Prevalence estimates vary, but up to around 7–11% of adolescents may exhibit signs of problematic use. Yet these estimates rely heavily on “addiction-like” measures, which may not capture context, motive, or the individual’s self-regulatory capacity.

Critics note that common PSMU measures often adapt clinical criteria for substance or gambling disorders, assuming that behaviors like craving, withdrawal, and tolerance map neatly onto social media use. This can blur distinctions between normal, adaptive behaviors (e.g., connecting with friends) and genuinely harmful patterns. Researchers increasingly call for more sophisticated frameworks that incorporate the user’s unique circumstances, motives, and ability to control their engagement.

## Importance of self-regulation
Self-regulation, particularly attentional control, emerges as key to understanding PSMU. Individuals who have difficulty focusing or controlling impulses—such as those with ADHD symptoms—may struggle to resist the lure of constant online stimulation. Evidence links ADHD-like inattention and impulsivity to PSMU, raising the possibility that what looks like addiction may be an expression of underlying self-control vulnerabilities.

> [!info]- Linking Attention and PSMU  
> Studies show that when attentional systems are taxed, maintaining deliberate control over social media use becomes harder. Users may repeatedly “check” platforms impulsively, turning to them as easy distractions. Over time, these ingrained habits can feel uncontrollable and distressing, manifesting as “problematic” use.

## Social Media Use Motives
Motives shape the nature and outcomes of social media engagement. People log on for entertainment, information, socializing, stress relief, procrastination, and more. Some motives, like seeking information or maintaining friendships, tend to produce positive or neutral outcomes. Others, like using social media as a primary mode of procrastination or habitually scrolling without intent, may contribute to more impulsive and problematic patterns. Thus, motives mediate the link between attention regulation and PSMU, differentiating between healthy and potentially harmful engagement.

> [!info]+ Motive Profiles Matter  
> **Social connection:** Often protective, providing supportive networks and meaningful interactions.  
> **Impulsive/habitual use:** Linked strongly to higher PSMU scores, reflecting difficulty in regulating attention and behavior online.  
> **Information seeking & entertainment:** Generally neutral, but may still vary based on personal contexts and self-regulatory capacity.

## Methods
This nested mixed-methods design integrated quantitative (survey-based) and qualitative (interviews/open-ended responses) approaches:

1. **Quantitative Component (N=607):**  
   - Participants: University students.  
   - Measures:  
     - BSMAS for PSMU  
     - ASRS for attention dysregulation (ADHD symptoms)  
     - Custom 12-item measure of social media motives  
     - DASS-21 for anxiety/depression.
   - Analytical Approach: Hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) to identify how attention dysregulation and motives predict PSMU.

2. **Qualitative Component (N=24):**  
   - Participants: Subset selected based on high attentional dysregulation plus high or low BSMAS scores.  
   - Method: Interviews or open-ended questionnaires about experiences managing social media use, perceived challenges, and how motives come into play.
   - Analytical Approach: Thematic analysis to explore lived experiences and contextual nuance.

### Participants and Procedures
Undergraduates participating for course credit were surveyed. For interviews, participants meeting ADHD screening criteria (ASRS≥5) and scoring in top or bottom BSMAS quartiles were invited, ensuring variation in perceived “problematicness.”

### Data Analysis
Quantitative: Data screened for reliability, assumptions checked, factors extracted, and SEM tested the structural relationships. Qualitative: Inductive coding identified themes around self-regulation struggles and the purposeful use of social media.

## Results
### Quantitative results
**Key Finding:** Attention dysregulation predicts higher PSMU scores primarily through impulsive, unintentional patterns of social media use. Instead of a direct link from attention difficulties to PSMU, the relationship is channeled through how people use platforms: those who mindlessly scroll or procrastinate with social media show stronger links to BSMAS scores.

The SEM revealed that motives related to social engagement actually correlated negatively with PSMU, suggesting that purposeful social use may be relatively protective. Wellbeing factors (anxiety/depression) were correlated with attention but did not directly drive PSMU. Rather, self-regulatory breakdowns were central.

> [!info]- Interpretation of SEM Findings  
> - **Attention → Impulsive Use → PSMU:** Individuals with attentional issues rely more on impulsive checks, leading to higher BSMAS scores.  
> - **Attention → Social Motives → PSMU:** Unexpectedly, strong social motives reduced PSMU risk, indicating that meaningful social uses may channel attention in constructive ways.  
> - **Anxiety/Depression:** Although these relate to attention problems, they don’t robustly predict PSMU. Emotional states alone don’t explain problematic patterns—how one engages and why matters more.

### Qualitative results
Participants with attentional dysregulation, whether scoring “high” or “low” on the BSMAS, described social media regulation as challenging and effortful. They often felt “lost” in feeds, struggling to stop scrolling, and recognized that awareness alone wasn’t enough to change behavior. They described using strategies like deleting apps, hiding their phone, or scheduling usage breaks, often with limited success.

Importantly, participants highlighted many positive, intentional uses of social media. They valued platforms for staying informed, learning new skills, connecting with distant friends, and sometimes escaping overwhelming stressors. Even those who felt highly distressed by their usage patterns noted tangible benefits. This overlap in experiences among high and low BSMAS scorers suggests that the scale may not adequately differentiate genuinely problematic use from difficulties that all attention-dysregulated users encounter.

> [!info]+ Thematic Insights  
> **The “Impossible Task” of Self-Regulation:** Managing usage required constant vigilance and external strategies.  
> **Purposeful Uses:** Participants relied on social media for entertainment, information, community-building, and even strategic avoidance of stress. These motivations didn’t always feel “addictive” but could become entangled with difficulties stopping once started.

## Discussion
The results underscore self-regulation—specifically, attention control—as a critical factor in interpreting PSMU. Rather than inherently addictive, social media may pose special challenges for individuals already prone to attention lapses. Their impulsive, habit-driven usage patterns magnify perceived problematicity, especially when measured by tools like the BSMAS, which may conflate context-dependent behaviors with pathological patterns.

That social connection motives were inversely related to PSMU is especially notable. It suggests that not all intense engagement is harmful. For example, heavy use driven by a desire to keep up with friends or family may be time-consuming but not necessarily problematic. This finding aligns with critiques of the addiction framework, indicating that current measures may fail to capture the nuance of why people use social media and how those motives shape outcomes.

The interviews reinforce these points. Participants with attention dysregulation across the BSMAS spectrum reported similar struggles—feeling drawn in by the platform’s endless novelty, working hard to impose external limits, and both benefiting and suffering from their usage. This raises questions about whether BSMAS truly discriminates different intensities of problematic engagement in populations with attentional issues.

> [!info]- Rethinking Measurement  
> The BSMAS and similar tools should be complemented by measures that consider context, self-regulatory capacity, and motive complexity. Future research might integrate ecological momentary assessments, examine situational self-control strategies, and focus on distinct “functional problems” of use rather than global “addiction.”

## Research Limitations
These findings come from a sample of young adult undergraduates, mostly female, which may not generalize to broader populations. Self-report measures and cross-sectional design limit causal inferences. The COVID-19 pandemic context may have affected usage patterns. Despite these constraints, the consistent patterns linking attention, impulsive use, and PSMU offer valuable insights.

## Conclusions
This study highlights attention dysregulation and usage motives as central to understanding PSMU. By examining how individuals experience their online behaviors, we see that “problematic” use may often reflect underlying self-control struggles rather than a discrete addiction. Social engagement motives appear to mitigate risk, suggesting that the nature, not just the quantity, of engagement matters. Going forward, research should refine measurements to distinguish harmful patterns from normal, purposeful behaviors, and to develop interventions that target self-regulation skills rather than demonizing social media itself.
