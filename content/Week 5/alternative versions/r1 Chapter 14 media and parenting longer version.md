# 14 MEDIA AND PARENTING

## Parenting in the Twenty-First Century
Parenting today often feels more complicated than in the past. Many parents worry that it has become harder, and that raising children in this era—one defined by constant media access—is more challenging than ever. Research suggests that a **warm, responsive, yet structured parenting style**, known as **authoritative parenting**, leads to better outcomes for children. Compared to parents who are strict with little warmth (authoritarian) or warm but lack boundaries (permissive), authoritative parents raise children who tend to be happier, more successful in school, and better at self-regulation.

**Self-regulation**—the ability to manage one’s impulses and goals—is crucial for lifelong well-being. The mission of authoritative parents is to provide consistent rules, explain those rules in a way that makes sense to the child, and gradually help the child internalize them. Through this process, children learn to follow guidelines voluntarily, eventually developing robust self-control in other areas of life, including managing their own media use.

### Setting Boundaries Does Not Mean Being Harsh
Authoritative parenting involves setting boundaries without sacrificing warmth. Yet parents often struggle to maintain this balance. Many fear that enforcing rules means being harsh, which can lead to inconsistent discipline. Inconsistent enforcement, such as occasionally giving in to temper tantrums or punishing too late or too severely, can trigger resistance and “reactance” in children. This reactance opposes internalization of parental rules and hampers the development of self-regulation. Thus, staying calm, empathetic, and consistent—especially when setting rules about media use—is key.

## Media Management in the Family
As children grow, parents must also regulate their offspring’s media behavior. Surprisingly, many parents find it harder to set limits on media use than on activities like going out, spending money, or trying alcohol. A reason for this difficulty is that children tend to view media use as a personal matter, one where they feel parental restrictions are not fully legitimate. While kids accept parental authority in moral (e.g., lying, stealing) and conventional (e.g., manners, homework) domains, they see their media choices as personal preferences.

As a result, restricting media content or time can easily spark pushback. Additionally, today’s media environment evolves quickly, and parents frequently feel uncertain or insecure about what is appropriate for their children. The shifting landscape—from traditional TV to mobile, interactive devices—has integrated media deeply into family life, making it both a social connector and a source of confusion and conflict.

## Parental Mediation in the Twenty-First Century
Early research defined three main mediation strategies: **restrictive mediation** (limiting time or content), **active mediation** (discussing and evaluating content), and **co-viewing** (watching together without discussion). Over time, it became clear that co-viewing can backfire if the content is harmful—parental presence may be misread as tacit approval.

Modern media practices add complexity. Children are not just passive recipients but also creators of content. Parents must now consider **proactive media monitoring**, overseeing what children do with media, who they interact with, and how much time they spend online. Proactive monitoring should ideally be a two-way street, with children willing to share their experiences. In authoritative families, proactive media monitoring aligns with children’s development and changing needs, adjusting strategies to fit a child’s specific susceptibilities and interests.

### Restrictive and Active Proactive Media Monitoring
**Restrictive monitoring** includes rules about when, where, and what can be consumed (e.g., “no phone at the dinner table” or “no violent video games”). While it can be effective for younger children, it often triggers reactance among teens. On the other hand, **active monitoring** involves talking with children about the content, clarifying differences between reality and fiction, and embedding parental values. Active strategies can reduce negative influences and enhance learning, making children more critical and thoughtful media users.

> **Tip:** For younger kids, setting clear, consistent rules about what shows or games are allowed can be effective. As children grow older, shifting to more conversational, active strategies may work better to help them think critically about what they watch or play.

## When Child Development and Proactive Media Monitoring Meet
Children’s media needs and vulnerabilities change with age. Very young children (babies and toddlers) have different challenges than older children or teens. Older children may show increased interest in violent content, and by adolescence, maintaining any sort of media limit becomes tougher.

Effectively managing media requires understanding these developmental shifts. Parents need different approaches for different age groups, using both restrictive and active strategies suited to the child’s evolving interests, emotional maturity, and peer influences.

## Babies, Toddlers, and Screen Time
Parents of infants and toddlers wonder if any screen time is appropriate at all. In recent decades, children under two have been exposed to screens more often—either “foreground” media intentionally shown to them or “background” media they happen to overhear. **Background media** (e.g., adult TV running in the same room) has been associated with lower-quality play and weaker parent-child interactions. However, evidence against all screen use is not absolute. Research that originally suggested severe consequences has been reanalyzed, showing that moderate exposure, especially to educational, developmentally appropriate media, may not be harmful. Indeed, some educational apps and age-appropriate shows can even be beneficial.

> [!info]+  Clarification on Guidelines: 
> - Old advice discouraged any screens for children under two.  
> - Newer thinking suggests that limited, high-quality, interactive content might be acceptable, particularly if parents co-view and guide.  
> - Background media, however, is consistently unhelpful or even detrimental.

> The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) once recommended no screen time before two, but this stance has softened. Reanalysis of key studies suggests that if media is carefully chosen and interactive, it can be more like a learning tool than passive television. Media that respond to a child’s actions and interests (such as certain educational apps) may foster learning and engagement, much like traditional play.

For very young children, the critical point is balance. Screen time should not replace activities that promote bonding, movement, and exploration. When screens are used, it’s best if parents are actively involved—talking about what appears on-screen, pointing out characters, and connecting concepts to the child’s life. Ensuring that media does not become an always-on default activity and keeping exposure short and meaningful help maintain a healthy media “diet.”

## Childhood and Media Violence
Around age five, many kids—especially boys—become more interested in violent media. Some children are more vulnerable to its effects, and exposure may increase aggression, restlessness, and reduce the quality of play. Authoritative parents can combat these negative influences through both restrictive and active strategies.

Banning certain violent shows or games outright can be effective for younger children, particularly if parents explain why, consider the child’s perspective, and consistently uphold the rules. Media ratings can provide guidance on which games or films are clearly intended for adults and thus unsuitable for children.

**Factual strategies** (pointing out that violent scenes are staged, unreal) can help younger children see violence as less acceptable. But older kids may find such explanations patronizing, reducing their effectiveness. **Evaluative strategies** (expressing disapproval of the violence, suggesting nonviolent solutions) generally yield better results, lowering children’s acceptance of aggression—provided the parent remains involved and supportive after viewing.

> [!info]+  Practical Example:
> Watching a superhero show with a young child? Instead of just saying, “They’re actors,” you might add, “Fighting hurts people. Isn’t it better if they talk or ask for help?” Such evaluative comments have been shown to reduce children’s tolerance for violence.

> [!info]-  Detail on Age Differences
> Younger kids still developing a sense of reality benefit from brief factual clarifications: “This is not real. It’s make-believe.” Older kids already know that; they need moral guidance that reframes violence as unnecessary or harmful. Giving alternative conflict-resolution strategies ensures they don’t just dismiss violence, but actually embrace pro-social thinking.

## Managing Media Use during the Teen Years
Teenagers present a new set of challenges. They value autonomy highly and often resist parental interference in their “personal domain,” which includes their media habits. Smartphones, in particular, complicate matters. Designed to captivate attention, smartphones deliver a constant stream of alerts and updates that trigger reward centers in the brain. Adults struggle with this, and teens—who are naturally more sensitive to social rewards and novelty—find it even harder.

Excessive smartphone or social media use can disrupt sleep, reduce downtime, and leave little room for reflection. Chronic stimulation might harm emotional well-being and creativity. Teens need help forming healthy media habits before phone use becomes automatic and unstoppable.

### Preventing Habit Formation and Supporting Autonomy
The best time to shape healthy habits is before they form. Parents can set examples with their own media use, establish ground rules before handing over a new device, and involve teens in the decision-making process. For example, together deciding on “no phones at dinner” or “phones off at bedtime” can increase teens’ sense of fairness and personal commitment to those rules.

**Autonomy-supportive restriction** acknowledges the teen’s perspective. Instead of imposing rigid bans, parents can explain why certain limits exist, discuss benefits of healthier habits, and co-create guidelines. This approach reduces the chances of rebellious behavior or deceit. It also aligns with authoritative parenting’s emphasis on internalized self-regulation. Over time, teens learn to regulate themselves, applying these habits when they go off to college or move out on their own.

> [!info]-  Further Insight:
> Research shows that authoritarian tactics—like threatening to take away the phone if a teen doesn’t comply—backfire. Teens might sneak their phone use or resent their parents. Meanwhile, consistently upholding agreed-upon rules, with empathy and reason, fosters trust and ultimately better self-control.

## Conclusion
Parents have significant influence on how children relate to media. While parenting in the twenty-first century feels daunting, especially given the speed of technological change, the core principles remain: **warmth, structure, consistency, and an appreciation for the child’s or teen’s perspective.**

Whether deciding if infants should watch educational shows, guiding young children away from violent media, or supporting teens in taming their smartphone habits, **authoritative, proactive media monitoring** can make a crucial difference. Often, the same logic applies as in generations past: encourage healthy choices, discourage harmful ones, and do so in a way that children can understand, accept, and internalize.

In short, parents need not become tech experts. Instead, they should leverage their understanding of child development, communicate openly, and help children gradually internalize good habits. By doing so, children learn to navigate media wisely—an essential skill in a world where screens are everywhere.
