Teaching self-control can be challenging, but a handful of specially designed apps can help younger kids manage their emotions, wait patiently, and stay on task. By simplifying concepts like calming down, expressing feelings, and handling transitions, these apps use fun activities and visuals to reinforce positive routines. They don’t replace guided parenting, but they can support strategies you already use at home.

## Daniel Tiger’s Grr-ific Feelings
Children explore their emotions through drawing, singing, and photo booth activities with familiar PBS characters. They learn to name and understand their feelings, and pick up simple tools to calm down when upset. Great for ages 2–5.

> Introducing emotional vocabulary and coping strategies at a young age can set the stage for better self-regulation as kids grow.

## Breathe, Think, Do With Sesame
Guides kids through slow breathing and problem-solving steps. Children help a friendly monster handle everyday challenges—like waiting in line—by taking deep breaths and picking calming strategies.

## Tico Timer
A visual timer that uses shrinking shapes instead of numbers. Ideal for kids who benefit from clear, playful cues about how long they need to wait or focus on a task.

> Setting a timer before switching from playtime to chores gives kids a gentle heads-up and helps reduce meltdowns.

## Zones of Regulation Apps
Kids learn to recognize when they’re feeling angry, upset, scared, or happy. These apps use color-coded “zones” with mini-games and adventures. Children discover coping methods to move from a frustrated state to a calmer one.

## Choiceworks and Choiceworks Calendar
Visual schedules, storyboards, and checklists help kids understand what’s next, how to wait, and what to do when feeling angry or sad. Perfect for kids who need step-by-step routines and predictable structures.

> Using the same app daily can reinforce routines. Over time, kids may rely less on the app and more on their own skills.

[Tweens](Definitions/Age%20ranges/tweens.md) and teens who learn and think differently often need extra tools to manage focus and impulsivity, control emotional responses, and think twice before acting. Three key apps can help:

## Pomodoro Apps
These time-management tools break work into short, focused intervals separated by brief breaks. By working in 20–30 minute “pomodoros,” kids can maintain attention on tasks, and then rest—improving focus and reducing frustration. Try free Pomodoro apps on Android or iOS to see which style your child prefers.

> [!info]+ Time Management Boost  
> Structured intervals can encourage consistent effort, reduce overwhelm, and help build a sense of accomplishment.

## Forest
Forest helps resist the urge to check the phone. Plant a virtual seed that grows into a tree if the user stays on task. Leaving the app too soon “kills” the tree. Over time, watching trees grow can motivate kids to avoid distractions.

## ReThink — Stop Cyberbullying
This app prompts teens to reconsider before sending hurtful messages. If they type something offensive, it flags it and suggests they rethink their words. This simple pause can help teens with impulse control avoid online regrets.

> ReThink creates a teachable moment: a gentle reminder that online actions have real consequences.
