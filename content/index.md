About the filenames:
* "Lecture" is the lecture summary
* Filenames starting with "r" are academic readings of that week
* Filenames starting with "x" are popular press of that week
* Filenames starting with "y" are contain links to some of the non-mandatory material
* Filenames starting with "z" are videos of that week

These letters were chosen somewhat arbitrarily and are only there because the files are automatically sorted alphabetically.

Files in folders "Book," "common_terms" and "Definitions" contain info that is embedded into the rest of the notes.
