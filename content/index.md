- **The lecturer mentions ongoing research initiatives and legislative efforts focused on youth and media, indicating their relevance to the field.**

### Moving Beyond the Hypodermic Needle Perspective (AAA)

- **The lecturer stresses the shift from the outdated "hypodermic needle" perspective, which assumed uniform and immediate media effects, to a more nuanced understanding.**
- **This is a crucial point that is very likely to be on the exam.**

### Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM) (AAA)

- **The DSMM, a key framework in the field, is introduced.**
- **This model posits that media effects are not uniform but vary based on individual susceptibility factors, media use patterns, and the resulting responses and effects, which influence each other in a cyclical process.**
- **Understanding and applying the DSMM is essential for the course and extremely likely to be on the exam.**

### Three Cs Model (AA)

- **The Three Cs model, used by practitioners, is also introduced.**
- **This model focuses on the Child, the Content, and the Context as key factors influencing media effects.**
- **While the lecturer notes that academics tend to use the DSMM, understanding both models and their connections is advisable.**

### Course Structure and Assignments

- **The course is structured around the DSMM, addressing different individual differences, media use patterns, and effects each week.** **(AA)**
- **The infographic assignment and the final exam are the two main assessments.** **(AA)**

### Key Terminology (AA):

- **Hypodermic Needle Perspective (AA)**
- **Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM) (AA)**

This overview provides a concise summary of the main points from Week 1's lecture, but it is not exhaustive. Refer to your lecture slides, notes, and readings for comprehensive exam preparation.

# Week 2

### Media Preferences and Selection Across Developmental Stages (AAA)

- **The lecturer emphasises the connection between developmental psychology and media preferences, highlighting its significance for the exam.**
- **Understanding how children's cognitive, linguistic, physical, social-emotional, and gender development influence their media choices is crucial.**

#### Moderate Discrepancy Hypothesis (AAA)

- **This hypothesis, also referred to as the "Goldilocks hypothesis", posits that children prefer content slightly above their current developmental level, striking a balance between too easy and too challenging.**
- **This concept is repeatedly mentioned and explained, suggesting its importance for the exam.**

### Developmental Theories (AAA)

#### Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development (AAA)

- **The lecturer focuses heavily on Piaget's theory and its implications for media preferences, making it a central concept for the exam.**
- **Understanding the four stages (sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, formal operational) and their characteristics is essential.**
    - **Sensorimotor (0-2 years):** Infants learn through sensory experiences and motor actions.
    - **Preoperational (2-7 years):** Young children develop symbolic thinking but struggle with logic and perspective-taking.
    - **Concrete Operational (7-11 years):** Children gain logical reasoning abilities but struggle with abstract concepts.
    - **Formal Operational (11 years and up):** Adolescents develop abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning.

#### Vygotsky's Sociocultural Theory of Development (AA)

- **While not the primary focus, Vygotsky's theory is also mentioned, suggesting its relevance for the exam.**
- **Key concepts include the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and scaffolding, emphasizing the role of social interaction and guidance in learning.**

### Media Preferences and Developmental Changes Across Age Groups (AAA)

- **The lecturer systematically examines how media preferences evolve across different age groups, connecting them to the developmental theories discussed.**
- **Expect exam questions requiring you to apply these theories to explain specific media preferences and analyse examples.**

#### Infants (Under 1 Year) (AA)

- **Orienting response develops around 4 months, allowing infants to attend to screens.**
- **Preference for simple, high-contrast visuals, slow-paced movement, and repetitive sounds.**

#### Young Toddlers (1-3 Years) (AA)

- **Transitioning from sensorimotor to preoperational stage, with increasing language comprehension and symbolic thinking.**
- **Enjoyment of simple narratives, brighter colours, faster pacing, and interactive elements.**

#### Preschoolers (4-5 Years) (AAA)

- **Limited information processing abilities (no working memory) and egocentric perspective.**
- **Attracted to familiar characters, repetitive storylines, and clear cause-and-effect relationships.**
- **Difficulty understanding complex narratives and distinguishing fantasy from reality.**

#### Middle Childhood (5-12 Years) (AAA)

- **Transitioning from preoperational to concrete operational stage, with developing logical reasoning and perspective-taking abilities.**
- **Preference for more complex narratives, realistic content, humour, and characters they can relate to.**
- **Increasing awareness of gender and social dynamics.**

#### Tweens (8-12 Years) (AAA)

- **Within the concrete operational stage, with continued development of logical thinking and social awareness.**
- **Increased interest in peer relationships, social media, and content reflecting their social world.**

#### Adolescents (13-18 Years) (AAA)

- **Entering formal operational stage, capable of abstract thought and complex reasoning.**
- **Heightened focus on identity development, social relationships, and emotional experiences.**
- **Preference for content reflecting their social and emotional complexities, including romantic relationships, risk-taking, and identity exploration.**
    - **Gender differences are noted**, with girls often showing more interest in social networking and relationship-focused content, while boys may gravitate towards gaming and action-oriented media.

### Key Terminology (AA):

- **Moderate Discrepancy Hypothesis (AA)**
- **Orienting Response (AA)**
- **Egocentrism (AA)**
- **Perceptually Bounded (AA)**
- **Centration (AA)**

This detailed overview covers the main concepts from Week 2's lecture, incorporating potential exam relevance and emphasizing individual differences and developmental factors. Remember to consult your lecture slides, notes, and readings for comprehensive exam preparation.
# Week 3

### Recap of Week 2 (AAA)

- The lecturer begins by recapping key concepts from the previous week, specifically mentioning the **moderate discrepancy hypothesis** **(AAA)** and how it applies to educational media. She stresses that **memorising the terms and age groups used in the course, and understanding how they relate to Piaget's stages of development, is crucial, as this information is essential for both the exam and the infographic assignment.**
- She reminds students that terms like **infants, toddlers, preschoolers, middle childhood, tweens, and adolescents** will be used throughout the course, and they **need to know which Piagetian stage each term corresponds to.**

### Educational Media (AAA)

- **Defining Educational Media (AA):** A significant portion of the lecture is dedicated to explaining what constitutes "educational media." **The lecturer underscores that, for the purposes of this course, the most important aspect of this definition is that it is research-based.** Educational media is further divided into two types:
    - **Academic Educational Media (AA):** This type of media systematically incorporates academic curricula, such as literacy, maths, science, social studies, and creativity, into its content. The lecturer provides examples of apps such as "Khan Academy Kids" and "DragonBox Numbers" as examples that incorporate academic learning into engaging interactive experiences.
    - **Prosocial Educational Media (AA):** This type of media focuses on systematically incorporating social-emotional curricula. Examples include content that promotes positive play, teaches children about sharing emotions, challenges stereotypes, and encourages inclusivity. The lecturer highlights a clip from _Sesame Street_ that teaches children about empathy.
- **The Importance of Age-Appropriate Content (AAA):** The lecturer emphasises that for educational media to be effective, it must be tailored to the specific cognitive and developmental characteristics of the target age group. Using examples of research on vocabulary learning from apps, she demonstrates how different age groups respond to different types of content.
    - **Younger children (3-year-olds) learn better from simpler apps that focus on basic interactions, like selecting bubbles**, as demonstrated in the "Super Why" app.
    - **Older children (5-7 year-olds) show greater vocabulary gains when using apps that include more complex narratives, interactivity, and faster pacing**, such as the app featuring the "Pinkalicious" book series.
    - The lecturer directly links this research to the **moderate discrepancy hypothesis**, explaining that **the "Super Why" app, while effective for younger children, proved too easy for older children, leading to decreased learning outcomes.** **The "Pinkalicious" app, on the other hand, was more developmentally appropriate for the older children, resulting in greater learning**.
- **Scaffolding (AA):** The concept of scaffolding, a technique used to support children's learning by providing gradually increasing levels of support, is presented as a crucial element of effective educational media design. The lecturer specifies that scaffolding can be implemented in educational media through:
    - **Levelling:** starting with easier levels and progressively increasing difficulty as the child masters the concepts.
    - **Hints and Clues:** providing assistance to guide the child towards the solution.
    - **Leveraging Wrong Answers:** using incorrect responses as opportunities for teaching and reinforcing concepts.

### Contexts of Educational Entertainment (AA)

- **Gaming (AA):** While acknowledging that the negative outcomes of gaming (e.g., addiction) will be addressed in week 5, the lecturer primarily focuses on its potential **educational benefits**. She highlights how gaming can foster various skills including:
    - Problem-solving
    - Creativity
    - Collaboration
    - Strategic thinking
- **Virtual Reality and Extended Reality (VR/XR) (AA):** The lecturer emphasises the potential of VR/XR technologies to create **highly immersive and engaging learning experiences**, arguing that **this potential is supported by research findings.** She stresses that to achieve these positive learning outcomes, **developers must prioritise the quality of the VR experience**, specifically the use of **realistic and high-quality graphics**. She illustrates this point with a research example where **the lack of realistic graphics in a VR experience designed to simulate bullying led to decreased empathy and perception of bullying as a problem.** This suggests that **immersiveness alone is not sufficient; the quality of the virtual environment plays a key role in learning outcomes.** The lecture also discusses four affordances of VR technology for educational purposes:
    - **Spatial Knowledge:** VR allows users to explore and interact with environments in a way that enhances their understanding of spatial relationships and concepts.
    - **High Sense of Presence:** The immersive nature of VR can create a strong feeling of being present in the virtual environment, potentially leading to increased engagement and learning.
    - **Experiential Learning Through Embodiment:** VR allows users to learn by doing, by embodying virtual characters and experiencing situations firsthand.
    - **Increased Intrinsic Motivation and Engagement:** The novelty and interactivity of VR can be highly motivating and encourage active participation in learning activities.
    - **Transfer of Knowledge and Skills (Situated Learning):** By providing realistic and contextualised learning experiences, VR can facilitate the transfer of knowledge and skills to real-world settings.

### Key Terminology and Acronyms (AA):

- **Academic educational media (AA)**
- **Prosocial educational media (AA)**
- **Scaffolding (AA)**
- **Self-determination theory (AA)**
- **DSMM (AA)**
- **VR (AA)**
- **XR (AA)**

Remember: **thoroughly review all lecture materials, assigned readings, and your notes to comprehensively prepare for the exam.**

# Week 4
### Defining Social Media (AA)

The lecturer emphasises that the definition of social media has evolved beyond traditional social networking sites. **For this course, social media encompasses any online platform facilitating social interaction**. This includes:

- Traditional sites: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok/X
- Communication apps: WhatsApp
- Virtual worlds and games with social features: Roblox, Fortnite
- Video platforms with social elements: YouTube, TikTok/X

**This broad definition is important for the exam**.

### Theoretical Frameworks (AA)

Two key models are used throughout the course, and are relevant to understanding social media:

- **Three Cs Model:** Child, Content, Context. This model, commonly used by practitioners, helps analyse how these factors interact to shape media experiences and effects.
- **Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM):** This model, favoured by academics, posits that individual differences (developmental, dispositional, social) influence media use and responses, leading to varying effects.

### Social Media in Childhood (5-12 Years Old) (AAA)

This section focuses on **middle childhood, particularly the 8-12 age range**. The lecturer highlights that despite age restrictions, many children in this group are active on social media.

#### Age Restrictions and Access (AA)

- European law sets the age limit for platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook at 13 with parental permission, or 16 without.
- The lecturer stresses that **many children circumvent these restrictions, often with parental awareness and support**.

#### Motivations for Social Media Use in Childhood (AA)

- **Socialisation:** Connecting with friends and family.
- **Entertainment:** Accessing fun and engaging content.
- **Status and Belonging:** Feeling part of a peer group.

#### Risks and Challenges (AA)

- **Cyberbullying:** Exposure to harassment and abuse online.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Sharing personal information without understanding the implications.
- **Exposure to Inappropriate Content:** Accessing material that is not age-appropriate.

#### Parental Mediation and Guidance (AA)

The lecturer underscores the **crucial role of parents in mediating children's social media use**. This includes:

- **Active Mediation:** Engaging with children's online activities, discussing online safety, and setting clear boundaries.
- **Restrictive Mediation:** Setting limits on screen time and access to certain platforms or content.

### Social Media in Adolescence (13-18 Years Old) (AAA)

This section shifts focus to adolescents, highlighting how their developmental stage shapes their social media experiences.

#### Developmental Considerations (AA)

Adolescence is marked by significant changes, including:

- **Puberty:** Hormonal fluctuations influence emotions, self-consciousness, and risk-taking tendencies.
- **Brain Development:** The prefrontal cortex, responsible for impulse control and decision-making, is still developing, leading to heightened sensitivity to social rewards and peer influence.
- **Identity Formation:** Social media plays a crucial role in exploring identities, seeking peer approval, and establishing social status.

#### Motivations for Social Media Use in Adolescence (AA)

- **Social Connection:** Maintaining and expanding social networks.
- **Self-Expression and Identity Exploration:** Curating online profiles to reflect their interests and desired image.
- **Romantic Relationships:** Navigating dating and relationships online.

#### Social Media and Well-being (AAA)

The lecturer emphasises the complex relationship between social media and adolescent well-being. **This is a key topic for the exam.**

- **Social Comparison:** Constant exposure to curated online profiles can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, envy, and low self-esteem.
- **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** The pervasiveness of social media can create anxiety about missing out on social events and experiences.
- **Body Image Concerns:** Exposure to idealised and often unrealistic images can fuel body dissatisfaction and disordered eating.
- **Mental Health:** Studies have linked excessive social media use to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness.

#### Cyberbullying (AA)

- Cyberbullying remains a significant risk for adolescents, with potentially severe consequences for mental health and well-being.
- The anonymity and reach of online platforms can amplify the impact of bullying.

#### Navigating Risks and Promoting Responsible Use (AA)

The lecturer stresses the need for strategies to mitigate the risks associated with social media use in adolescence:

- **Media Literacy Education:** Equipping adolescents with critical thinking skills to evaluate online information and navigate the complexities of the digital world.
- **Digital Citizenship:** Fostering responsible and ethical online behaviour, including respect for others and awareness of privacy concerns.
- **Parental Involvement:** Continued guidance and open communication with adolescents about their online experiences.

### Key Terminology (AA):

- **Social Comparison (AA)**
- **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) (AA)**
- **Cyberbullying (AA)**
- **Active Mediation (AA)**
- **Restrictive Mediation (AA)**
- **DSMM (AA)**

This overview is not exhaustive, but captures the major themes and potential exam focuses from Week 4. Consult your notes, readings, and lecture slides for comprehensive preparation.

# Week 5

### Self-Regulation and Media Use (AAA)

The lecturer defines self-regulation as "the ability to control one's thoughts, emotions, and behaviours to achieve desired goals." This ability is crucial in the context of media use, particularly for children and adolescents whose self-regulation skills are still developing. **This concept and its application to media use are central to this week's topic and likely to appear on the exam.**

#### Development of Self-Regulation (AA)

Self-regulation develops gradually throughout childhood and adolescence, influenced by:

- **Brain Development**: The prefrontal cortex, responsible for executive functions like impulse control and planning, matures over time.
- **Cognitive Development**: As children grow, they gain better understanding of their own emotions and develop strategies for managing them.
- **Social Influences**: Parents, peers, and cultural norms shape children's understanding of appropriate behaviour and self-control.

#### Self-Regulation and Media Overuse (AAA)

**The lecturer emphasises the link between underdeveloped self-regulation and media overuse**, which can have negative consequences for academic performance, sleep, physical activity, and mental well-being.

#### Individual Differences in Self-Regulation (AA)

- **Age**: Younger children generally have less developed self-regulation skills compared to older children and adolescents.
- **Temperament**: Some children are naturally more impulsive or sensation-seeking, making it harder to regulate media use.
- **ADHD**: Children with ADHD often face challenges with executive functions, including self-regulation, making them more susceptible to media overuse.

### Problematic Media Use (AAA)

The lecture distinguishes between **media overuse**, which refers to excessive time spent using media, and **problematic media use**, which is characterised by:

- Loss of control over media use.
- Continued use despite negative consequences.
- Interference with daily life, school, work, or relationships.

#### Theories Explaining Problematic Media Use (AA)

- **Cognitive-Behavioural Model**: This model suggests that problematic media use develops through a cycle of triggers (e.g., stress, boredom), problematic thoughts and feelings (e.g., "I need to check my phone"), media use as a coping mechanism, and negative consequences (e.g., guilt, sleep deprivation) that reinforce the cycle.
- **Social Learning Theory**: This theory posits that individuals learn behaviours, including problematic media use, through observation and reinforcement from their social environment (e.g., parents, peers).

#### Risk Factors for Problematic Media Use (AA)

- **Individual Factors**:
    - Low self-esteem.
    - Anxiety or depression.
    - Impulsivity or sensation-seeking.
- **Social Factors**:
    - Lack of parental monitoring and guidance.
    - Peer pressure and social norms around media use.
- **Content Factors**:
    - Engaging or addictive features of media content.
    - Exposure to idealised or unrealistic content that can contribute to social comparison and dissatisfaction.

### Media Addiction (AA)

The lecturer acknowledges the debate surrounding **"media addiction"** as a formal diagnosis. While there is no consensus in the scientific community, the term is used to describe a severe form of problematic media use with significant negative consequences.

#### Signs of Potential Media Addiction (A)

- Withdrawal symptoms when media use is restricted.
- Preoccupation with media use.
- Failed attempts to control or reduce media use.
- Lying about the extent of media use.
- Using media to escape from negative feelings.

### Strategies for Preventing and Managing Problematic Media Use (AA)

- **Parental Mediation**:
    - Setting clear limits and rules around media use.
    - Encouraging alternative activities and hobbies.
    - Open communication with children about their media use and experiences.
- **Media Literacy Education**:
    - Helping children and adolescents develop critical thinking skills to evaluate media content and understand its potential influence.
    - Teaching them strategies for managing their own media use and avoiding overuse.
- **Self-Monitoring and Self-Control Strategies**:
    - Setting personal goals for media use.
    - Using apps or tools to track and limit screen time.
    - Identifying and avoiding triggers that lead to excessive media use.
- **Professional Help**: Seeking professional guidance from therapists or counsellors for individuals struggling with severe problematic media use or potential addiction.

### Key Terminology (AA):

- **Self-regulation (AA)**
- **Media overuse (AA)**
- **Problematic media use (AA)**
- **Media addiction (AA)**
- **Executive functions (AA)**
- **Prefrontal cortex (AA)**

Remember that this overview highlights key points from the lecture, but is not exhaustive. Refer to your lecture slides, notes, and readings for comprehensive exam preparation.

# Week 6
### Why and When Representation Matters (AA)

The lecturer emphasises the significance of media representation, particularly for children and adolescents. She highlights research indicating that **over 80% of teens report feeling isolated or upset when they encounter inaccurate representations of their identities.** This underscores the need for media to accurately and inclusively represent the diversity of young people.

### Measuring and Conceptualising Media Representation (AA)

The lecturer outlines two key dimensions of media representation that researchers consider:

- **Quantity (AA):** This dimension focuses on the frequency with which different identities are represented in media content. It assesses how often specific groups are portrayed and whether their representation is proportional to their presence in society.
- **Quality (AA):** This dimension delves deeper into the nature of representation. It examines how different identities are portrayed, considering factors such as:
    - **Character depth:** Are characters from diverse backgrounds portrayed as complex individuals with nuanced personalities, motivations, and experiences?
    - **Stereotypes (AA):** Does the representation rely on harmful stereotypes or tropes that perpetuate negative biases about certain groups?
    - **Agency and Power (AA):** Are characters from marginalised groups depicted as having agency and power, or are they limited to stereotypical roles and narratives?

### Identity Development and Media Representation (AAA)

The lecturer emphasises that **children and adolescents develop a sense of self in relation to others, and media plays a significant role in this process. This topic is highly likely to appear on the exam.** She explains how children learn to distinguish between "in-group" and "out-group" members and how media representations can influence their perceptions and attitudes towards different groups. Key concepts include:

- **Racial/Ethnic Identity Development (AA):** The lecturer discusses research highlighting how media representations contribute to children's understanding of race and ethnicity. She explains that children go through different stages of racial/ethnic identity development, and media can play a role in shaping their sense of belonging, self-esteem, and attitudes towards other racial/ethnic groups.
- **Gender Identity Development (AA):** Similar to racial/ethnic identity, the lecturer explains how media representations of gender roles and expectations can influence children's understanding of their own gender identity and their perceptions of what it means to be male or female.

### How Media Can Socialise Others (AA)

The lecturer highlights how young people can use media to educate others about their identities and to challenge stereotypes and biases. She provides examples of how media can be a tool for promoting understanding, empathy, and acceptance of diversity. She also cautions that **the effectiveness of media in promoting positive social change is not guaranteed.** She uses the "three-legged dog" example to illustrate this point, explaining that while well-intentioned media messages may raise awareness of certain issues, they may not always lead to the desired changes in attitudes or behaviours.

#### Example: LGBTQ+ Teens Using Media to Educate Parents (A)

- One of the assigned readings explores how **LGBTQ+ teens use media to discuss their sexual orientation with their parents.** It found that teens often share media content, such as TV shows or movies, featuring LGBTQ+ characters as a way to initiate conversations about their own identity and to challenge their parents' preconceived notions. **While this specific study may not be heavily emphasised on the exam, it provides a relevant example of how media can be used to socialise others about sensitive topics.**

### The Impact of Media Representation on Attitudes and Beliefs

- **Impact on Perceptions of Gender Roles (A):** Research suggests that media representations can reinforce traditional gender stereotypes, leading to the development of biased attitudes and beliefs about gender roles and expectations.
- **Cultivation Theory (AA):** The lecturer introduces **cultivation theory (AA)**, which suggests that **long-term exposure to media can shape an individual's perceptions of the world.** Applied to the context of media representation, this theory suggests that **individuals who consume media that consistently underrepresents or misrepresents certain groups may develop distorted views about those groups, believing that the media's portrayal reflects reality.**
- **Social Cognitive Theory (AA):** The lecturer also discusses **social cognitive theory (AA),** which emphasises the role of **observational learning.** This theory suggests that **children and adolescents learn by observing the behaviours and attitudes of others, including those they see in the media.** Applied to the context of media representation, this theory suggests that **exposure to diverse and positive representations of different groups can contribute to the development of more inclusive attitudes and beliefs.**

#### Example: Portrayals of Women and Sexual Assault (AA)

- The lecturer presents a concerning example related to media representations of women and sexual assault. **This specific example, with its potential societal consequences, is likely to appear on the exam.** Research suggests that **exposure to media content that depicts women in a sexualised or objectified manner can lead to the normalisation of such portrayals and the acceptance of violence against women.** This can have detrimental effects on adolescents' attitudes towards gender and sexuality, potentially increasing the risk of perpetuating harmful behaviours.

### Key Considerations for Media Creators and Consumers (AA)

The lecturer emphasises the importance of creating more **diverse and inclusive media content that avoids harmful stereotypes and provides authentic portrayals of different identities.** She also stresses **the role of parents, educators, and society in critically evaluating media representations and engaging in conversations with young people about the messages they encounter.**

### Key Terminology and Acronyms (AA):

- **Quantity (AA)**
- **Quality (AA)**
- **Stereotypes (AA)**
- **Agency and Power (AA)**
- **In-group/Out-group (AA)**
- **Racial/Ethnic Identity Development (AA)**
- **Gender Identity Development (AA)**
- **Cultivation Theory (AA)**
- **Social Cognitive Theory (AA)**

Remember: Thoroughly review your notes, assigned readings, and the lecture slides to ensure you have a strong grasp of the key concepts and theories discussed in week 6. Pay attention to the ways in which media representation can influence identity development, perceptions of self and others, and societal attitudes towards diversity.
# Week 7 (short version)
