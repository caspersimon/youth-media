**Cognitive development** is about the age-specific ways kids “acquire and process information in their environment” (p. 45). Jean [[Piaget]] wrote about four stages of cognitive development and his theory is still used today! So that’s a name to remember. ^a78241

**Social-emotional development** is about the “ability to express and recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, jealousy, and shame; to form interpersonal relationships; and to develop an identity” (p. 45). Social-emotional development of course relates to cognitive development, because with small brain children can’t do, for example, empathy, or complex emotions like shame. ^e7f14b
