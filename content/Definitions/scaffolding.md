starting small and gradually building on given knowledge ^8e8023

## How?
Two main ways: levelling, hints and clues

> [!quote]- Levelling (from [[Revelle (2013) Educational Games]])
> Computer games almost always include a sequence of game levels that increase in difficulty as the player becomes more proficient and advances in the game. Learning is enhanced by increasing the cognitive demands as game levels progress, rather than simply the demand on psychomotor skills (manual dexterity
> or eye-hand coordination). Accordingly, early levels provide more scaffolding for children's learning, which is gradually removed as the player progresses through game levels.

> The child's selection of a wrong answer also provides an opportunity for scaffolding support. When the child makes an incorrect choice, the game can provide additional support in the form of hints or clues for approaching the problem. These clues can offer progressively more help with each subsequent mistake, until the child is capable of solving the problem. 
Revelle, Medoff, & Strommen (2001) provide a thorough description of the process for incorporating scaffolding for learning within
children's educational games.
