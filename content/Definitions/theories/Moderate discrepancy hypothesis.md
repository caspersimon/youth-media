**Moderate discrepancy hypothesis** is the idea that children prefer media content that “can at least partly fit into their cognitive and social-emotional frame of reference” (p. 46). That is, they are uninterested in content that is very easy for them to understand, but they also avoid content that they don’t understand yet. The moderate discrepancy hypothesis can explain why preferences for media change as kids grow up.
