### Now- DSMM
They go over some of the more modern views and then say that the Differential Susceptibility to Media effects Model (DSMM) is the combination of those other models and theories. Because it was made by UvA lecturers, it is obviously the best model we can use. They don’t have a figure of the model but I think it helps with explaining it, so I added it here.

(Yes this is the highest quality image I could find. It’s from the [original paper](https://www.pattivalkenburg.nl/images/artikelen_pdf/2013_Valkenburg__Peter_Differential_Susceptibility_Meda_Effects.pdf) that introduced it)
#### Ideas Behind DSMM
The DSMM starts by the user of the media. It says that **dispositional**, **developmental** **and social factors predict media use**. Dispositional are things about inherent qualities of people’s mind and character. Developmental are things about age and how much developed someone is, social factors is about what your parents let you watch and what your friends think are cool.

It also says that **dispositional**, **developmental** and **social factors moderate media response states** (and therefore media effects).

Finally, it says that media effects are transactional (in the book: reciprocal)
