#### The Spinach Syndrome

“Five year-olds reject anything that is supposed to be good for them” (p. 66). That’s why they stop liking educational programmes like Dora the Explorer and start to “prefer content that is faster and more complex, relies on less friendly characters, and uses more adventurous contexts, such as unexplored islands or alien planets” (p. 66).

Why else do they like this fast-paced content?

| Entertainment Preferences            | Action-packed entertainment offers elements that young children enjoy, such as action, physical humor, and moving characters.                                                                 |                                                                                                                                        |
| Rebellion and Wishful Identification | Action and violence in entertainment can serve as a form of rebellion against adult restrictions. Superheroes, in particular, allow children to escape and imagine having power and strength. |                                                                                                                                        |
| Peer Influence                       | Media content featuring groups of peers becomes more appealing as children’s social interactions with peers become more important in their lives.                                             |                                                                                                                                        |

  

Also: they start to appreciate “binary characters,” as in, those that are extremely one thing (evil, good, masculine, feminine). Parents find these characters stereotypes (because they often are), but children find these characters interesting because they use those portrayals to understand the world around them, and understand their own gender!
