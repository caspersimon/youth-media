Games can satisfy fundamental psychological needs
1. Competence = efficacy (skill/mastery)
2. Autonomy = volition (freedom to create/discover)
3. Relatedness = social connectedness (social aspects e.g. meet people, communicate with people on video games )

And games can provide both fun and meaning (hedonic and eudemonic enjoyment)
## Psychological needs

> [!info]- Need for competence
> Pacing of challenges is often designed so players can continually experience enhanced competence as they progress in the game – balancing player skill against game challenges
> 
> e.g. you do not start at level 100 when first playing a game because too hard so you’ll have high level of anxiety because it is too hard so you will not continue playing it. So they start out easy and as you go along it will get higher - a balance between the level not being too easy so you are bored and not too hard where you get anxiety.

> [!info]- Need for autonomy
> * Customization (e.g., fortnite skins)
> * Freedom of choice 
> * What to build and govern?
> * Where to go and what to do?

> [!info]- Need for relatedness
> You can cooporate or compete
> You can connect and find community
> You can develop parasocial relationships with characters in games

## Outcomes

**Intrinsic motivation** (playing a game because you enjoy it) arises from 3 fundamental human needs (mentioned above)

When games satisfy these psychological needs – players:
* Are **intrinsically** **motivated** to play
* Experience positive short-term shifts in well-being 
* Experience increased immersion in game world, which 
* and this potentially enhances the educational effects
