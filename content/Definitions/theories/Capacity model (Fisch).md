## Capacity model (Fisch)
Explains how children can extract and comprehend educational content from TV

* **Your working memory is limited** #important in childhood (but they do use working memory to process TV content). So comprehension is limited because your focus on multiple things is also limited.
* When the demands of processing a TV programme exceeds the capacity of working memory, then the children cannot process the educational message and don’t have the educational outcomes. Dependent on:
	* Narrative content 
	* Educational content 
	* The distance between the two
* With limited capacity, you process the narrative first. If you don’t have enough capacity left after that to process the educational message, you don’t get the learning outcome
* So if narrative and educational parts are too far apart (*tangential*), the kids will process narrative first and not enough capacity left to process educational message
* If narrative and educational content closely linked (*integral*), then children can process the message better and they have the learning outcomes too

> - Reduce complexity (participatory cues – e.g. Dora asking audience to do things and familiar context  - e.g. places kids have been so doctor’s office, the beach, etc.)
> - Use entertaining narrative structure that follows narrative conventions (= story has beginning – middle – end)
> - Present educational content that is clear, explicit and visually concrete
> - Integrate educational content within narrative (so narrative and educational should be close together)

> * **Repetition** also key factor in designing effective educational content
