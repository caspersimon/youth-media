## Social cognitive (learning) theory (Bandura)
Basic idea: behaviour can be learned through observation of others
### Consequences matter
* Rewarded behaviour – more likely to be modelled 
* Punished behaviour – less likely to be modelled

### Type of model matters 
* Children more likely to imitate attractive model

### Four processes must occur for modelling the behaviour:
1. Attention, 
2. retention (remembering the behaviour that they saw), 
3. motoric reproduction (physical ability to do behaviour) and 
4. motivation
