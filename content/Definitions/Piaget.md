According to Jean Piaget's theory of [cognitive development](Definitions/Development%20types.md), the four stages of development are:

1. **Sensorimotor stage**: This stage occurs from birth to approximately 2 years old. During this stage, infants and young children learn by using their senses and motor skills to interact with the environment.
2. **Preoperational stage**: This stage occurs from approximately 2 to 7 years old. Children in this stage begin to use symbols and language to represent the world, but they are not yet able to think logically or understand cause-and-effect relationships.
3. **Concrete operational stage**: This stage occurs from approximately 7 to 11 years old. Children in this stage can think logically and solve problems using concrete objects and events, but they may struggle with abstract concepts.
4. **Formal operational stage**: This stage occurs from approximately 12 years old and up. Adolescents and adults in this stage can think logically and abstractly, reason hypothetically, and consider multiple perspectives.

It's worth noting that these age ranges are approximate and can vary depending on the individual child's development. Additionally, Piaget's theory has been influential but also subject to criticism and revision over the years.

# implications for educational media
Age matters! Developers need to consider:

* Emotional understanding of your audience
* Do viewers judge characters by appearance (perceptual boundedness)
* Does saliency matter? (centration)
* Is your concept too abstract? (preoperational reasoning – so younger children won’t be able to understand too abstract concepts whereas older children will)
