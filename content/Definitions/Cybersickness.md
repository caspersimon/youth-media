People experience motion sickness from using VR, and this can be triggered by:
* High latency between your movements and VR responses
* Low refresh rate (choppy visuals)
* Misalignment with lenses with your eye distances
* Slow or inaccurate tracing of hand movements
* Low resolution

Some people have it more than others:
* (On average) women feel more nausea due to hormonal differences or variations in depth perceptions
* People with vestibular disorders (like the part in your ear responsible for balance)
* People older than 50

Why? There are many different explanations! Yay!

> [!info]+ Sensory Conflict Theory
> Motion sickness occurs because your eyes see movement in the VR world, but your body stays still, which confuses your brain and makes you feel nauseous

> [!info]+ Eye Movement Theory
> Motion sickness happens due to the unnatural eye movements required to stabilise the image on the retina

> [!info]+ Evolutionary (Poison) Theory
> The brain interprets these different signals your brain gets from using VS as a potential indication of poisoning, triggering nausea, sweating, and vomiting as a protective mechanism to expel what it perceives as harmful

> [!info]+ The Postural Instability Theory
> Losing postural control causes VR motion sickness
> 
> In VR, the visual and sensory inputs the brain receives can significantly differ from what it expects based on previous experiences in the real world.
> 
> When the brain struggles to integrate these conflicting signals and maintain balance, it can result in symptoms of motion sickness.
