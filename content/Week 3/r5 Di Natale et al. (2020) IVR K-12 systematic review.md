## Affordances of immersive virtual reality (IVR) #important

> [!tip] Example exam question
> Authors mention four affordances, can you describe them and give a short example of how they are supported by research?

1. Spatial knowledge --> presence
2. Experiential learning --> embodiment
3. Increased intrinsic motivation and engagement
4. transfer of knowledge and skills --> situated learning

# Immersive virtual reality in K-12 and higher education:

## A 10-year systematic review of empirical research
This summary reviews research from 2010–2019 on **immersive virtual reality (IVR)** systems used in both K-12 and higher education. It focuses on how IVR affects **learning outcomes** (e.g., knowledge attainment, retention) and **motivational factors** (e.g., engagement, interest). The reviewed studies (n=18) examined various school subjects—mostly in science education—and primarily involved the use of **head-mounted displays (HMDs)**. While the evidence suggests that IVR can enhance spatial understanding, experiential learning, and motivation to learn, the methodological quality of the studies varies. Overall, IVR provides unique educational opportunities, but further research is needed to better understand its affordances, minimize cognitive load, and ensure reliable assessment methods.

This research team, affiliated with Italian universities, specializes in **psychology, communication, and new technology ergonomics**. Their expertise informs the systematic review of IVR’s impact on educational practices and outcomes.

## Abstract
IVR offers multiple learning affordances—realistic 3D worlds, strong sense of presence, and embodied interaction—potentially improving knowledge acquisition, retention, and motivation. This review of 18 empirical studies highlights that IVR can support learner-centered, experiential, and situated learning. Students often show improved conceptual understanding and positive motivational responses after IVR interventions. However, methodological constraints (e.g., small samples, non-validated measures) limit the generalizability of these findings. Future research should employ more rigorous designs and consider how to reduce cognitive load while optimizing engagement.

## Introduction
Contemporary education emphasizes **learner-centered approaches** that foster active engagement and motivation. **Constructivist theories** suggest learners build knowledge through sensory experiences and interactions. Against this backdrop, **IVR emerges as a potentially powerful tool** enabling students to experience otherwise unreachable scenarios, manipulate complex data, and engage deeply with learning material. Past reviews focused on desktop-based VR; this summary concentrates explicitly on **fully immersive VR systems** and their learning affordances.

| Practitioner Notes |
| -- |
| **What is known:** IVR usage is growing in education, providing a sense of presence, embodiment, and engagement. **What this paper adds:** It identifies IVR’s cognitive and affective affordances, highlights positive effects on learning and motivation, and offers guidance for future research. **Implications:** Educators and policymakers can leverage affordable VR devices to enhance learning outcomes. |

## Virtual reality systems and immersion
**Immersion** is the extent to which VR systems replace real-world perceptions. **Degrees of immersion** vary from non-immersive desktop VR to semi-immersive systems (e.g., fulldomes, augmented reality setups) and fully immersive settings (HMDs, CAVEs). HMDs often track head and body movements, yielding **egocentric navigation** and increased presence. These properties contribute to deeper involvement and potentially richer learning experiences.

## IVR learning affordances
Dalgarno and Lee’s (2010) framework identifies key educational affordances of 3D virtual learning environments. Applied to IVR, four affordances emerge:

**1. Spatial knowledge representation:**  
IVR lets learners explore and interact with complex 3D content directly, improving their understanding of spatial relationships.

**2. Experiential learning:**  
IVR enables **first-person, embodied experiences**, even of phenomena not possible in the real world (e.g., navigating inside a human cell). Students can perform actions and manipulate virtual objects, leading to better comprehension and memory.

**3. Intrinsic motivation and engagement:**  
IVR’s immersive nature often elicits excitement, emotional arousal, focused attention, and deep engagement, increasing intrinsic motivation to learn.

**4. Transfer of knowledge and skills:**  
IVR can simulate realistic contexts to promote **situated learning**, improving the transfer of knowledge to real-life situations.

> [!info]+ Enhanced Embodiment  
> Embodiment in IVR means learners feel as if their virtual body and perspective align with the environment. By using natural movements (turning one’s head, bending, or reaching), students ground abstract concepts in sensory-motor activity, reinforcing retention and conceptual understanding.

### Present study
This systematic review maps recent empirical research using IVR in K-12 and higher education. It examines how IVR improves understanding of school subjects (like biology, anatomy, physics) and how it affects motivation. The review includes only studies that tested
