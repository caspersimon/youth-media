Most apps lack rigorous research backing their claims of improving learning and well-being.

The focus is often on screen time rather than demonstrable educational outcomes. This lack of evidence makes it difficult to assess the true value of edtech investments

To address these issues, the author calls for increased collaboration between researchers, developers, and policymakers. Specific recommendations:
## Rigorous research and evaluation
Governments should instruct that apps marketed as educational undergo scientific scrutiny to demonstrate their impact on learning and well-being
## Meaningful partnerships
Companies need to engage with specialists in the design, evaluation, and innovation of educational tools.
## Improved data availability
Researchers need access to raw data collected by companies to conduct thorough analyses. Initiatives like the Tools Competition 2025, which incentivize open data sets, are encouraging steps in this direction
## Standardised outcome measures
A unified framework for evaluating the effectiveness of educational apps is essential. The current abundance of assessment frameworks makes comparing apps and understanding their impact challenging.
# Conclusion
This framework should consider the diverse ways learning manifests in different individuals.

Addressing these issues is crucial to prevent the misuse of resources and ensure that edtech fulfils its potential to enhance learning for all children.
