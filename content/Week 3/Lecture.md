# Education in [early](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Early%20childhood.md) and [middle childhood](Definitions/Age%20ranges/middle%20childhood.md)
## Parents and caregivers
Some fun facts: #funfact
* 72% of parents of 0-8 year olds say that educational media help their child's learning
* 60% of parents of 0-5 year olds download an app for their child "to support learning"
* Parents of 0-8 year olds are generally satisfied with the quality of eduactional media content (68-83% is satisfied)

Good to realise that parents are the gatekeepers that decide which content their kids use.

Parents that say educational media has taught their 2-10 year old kid "a lot" about a specific subject:

| Percentage | Subject          |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| 37%        | Cognitive skills |
| 37%        | Reading/vocab    |
| 28%        | Math             |
| 25%        | Social skills    |
| 21%        | healthy habits   |
| 19%        | Science          |
| 15%        | Arts/culture     |
## Parenting strategies matter
* Parental warmth, engagement, playfulness, and autonomy support all predicted more positive child affect during joint interactions with the literacy and math educational game apps
* High-quality parent-child interactions (e.g. question asking) during TV viewing support learning 
  Parents unsure of best practice to support their childrenâ€™s learning during co-play interactions (especially for new tech)

#funfact: kids have better reading comprehension from traditional books compared to iPad books 

## Educational media use 
* 2-4 years old: 78%
* 5-7 years old: 39%
* 8-10 years old: 27%

## Educational media
Is it good for kids?
Basically yes! It is important for kids.

We, however, do not know if the apps sold as educational are backed by research and so whether they can be marketed as educational or not. See [Kucirkova (Nature, 2024)- Educational Apps](Nature,%202024)-%20Educational%20Apps)-%20Educational%20Apps.md). 

There are different types of educational media.

![Academic educational media](Definitions/Academic%20educational%20media.md)

![Prosocial educational media](Definitions/Prosocial%20educational%20media.md)

### Short- and long-term effects of watching [Sesame street](common_terms/Sesame%20street.md) ([Academic educational media](Definitions/Academic%20educational%20media.md))

> [!info](common_terms/Sesame%20street.md) are better at school at age 3 and age 10+
> #### Short-term (3 years old)
> Compared to kids that did not watch [Sesame street](common_terms/Sesame%20street.md), those that did had higher/better:
> * time spent reading 
> * letter-word knowledge
> * math skills
> * vocab size
> * school readiness 
> #### Long-term (10+ years)
> Those that did watch [Sesame street](common_terms/Sesame%20street.md) as a kid, at 10 years old have better/higher/more:
> * grades in English
> * grades in Math and Science 
> * value on books
> * value: academic self-esteem
> * value: academic performance

### Effects of [prosocial content](Definitions/Prosocial%20educational%20media.md)

> [!info]- TL;DR: effects depend on age of audience
> Exposure to prosocial content predicts:
> * Higher positive social interactions
> * Lower levels of aggression 
> * Higher levels of altruism (= selflessness)

> * Perspective taking helped with understanding the message of the show but important to know which ages your audiences are. 
>   
>   If they had shown this clip to younger children, they do not have the perspective taking ability yet to be able to take the perspective of the character in the show and have these learning outcomes of the moral judgement.
> * Older children able to engage in more reasoning

# Gaming
Why do we care about games? Children construct their knowledge of the world through interaction with the world around them so games work really well when it comes to this.
* well-designed educational games support educational outcomes
* study by Clark showed that digital games have positive impact on learning
## Why do we play games? [Self-Determination Theory](Definitions/theories/Self-Determination%20Theory.md)!

## Game-design factors that matter
The content should be [moderately discrepant](Definitions/theories/Moderate%20discrepancy%20hypothesis.md)

So, designers should incorporate [](Definitions/scaffolding.md#^8e8023|scaffolding) into their game design

# VR

This is a thing used for kids 12+ (so [Adolescence](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Adolescence.md))

Teens think VR is at school is **good** because it is fun, creative, and helps with (e-)learning. But its costs are high and VR is addictive, teens say.

> [!abstract]+ TL;DR
> IVR supports various activities that improve learning and motivate students to achieve educational goals
> 
> **Primary advantage** of IVR is the ability for users to have firsthand experiences that would not be possible in the real world.
> 
> Several studies highlighted **cognitive load** as a potential barrier to the effectiveness of IVR
> 
> **[Cybersickness](Definitions/Cybersickness.md)** is an important consideration when implementing virtual programs, as it can discourage use.

> [!info]+ What is VR?
> ### Technology
> * New reality in which physical world is partly shut out 
> * Adaptable (appearance, sense, interactions, context)
> * Tracking movement, multisensory
> * Rendering those data into a virtual world
> * First-person or third-person perspective
> ### Psychology
> * Immersion 
> * Presence (experience of person; self, social, spatial)
> * High level of presence --> very real

![Di Natale et al. (2020](Di%20Natale%20et%20al.%20(2020)%20IVR%20K-12%20systematic%20review.md#Affordances%20of%20immersive%20virtual%20reality%20(IVR)%20important)

## When does IVR work for learning?

1. Increased interest, enjoyment and motivation
2. Make abstract concepts more concrete
3. Create direct connection between motor and visual cues  ([Revelle (2013](Revelle%20(2013)%20Educational%20Games.md#^tl93x1|theory%20of%20embodied%20cognition))
4. Allows people to see information from different perspectives
5. High level of presence allows for sense of agency
6. Allows for knowledge transfer: context of learning

## Potential barriers for IVR
* Cognitive theory of multimedia learning + cognitive load theory
  Basically, there is too much going on. This increased cognitive load paired with a limited processing capacity in younger adolescence. So they cannot learn from it.
* Too many distractors
* Unfamiliarity with new tech (learning curve is too steep)
* Collisions (if too many people using VR in real life, they might hit each other)
* Too real

## Beyond education

> [!info]+ Identity development
> * **[Proteus effect](Definitions/Proteus%20effect.md), first person**: you identify with an avatar (you know it is different from you) but you apply the experiences to yourself.
> * **Doppelganger effect, third person:** you see the avatar as an extension of yourself

> [!info]+ Perspective taking
> We learn more and care more about others because of perspective taking

> [!info]+ Teaching young people to be more than bystanders?
> A study found the opposite:
> * More empathy for victim in ==video== than VR conditions
> * More students perceived bullying as a problem in ==video== than VR conditions
> 
> Why?
> * the characters in VR looked like sims (not photorealistic) and this affected empathy
> * they couldn't interact with the situation (like they couldnt actually stop the bullying)
> 
> Takeaways:
> * VR should be photorealistic (**high quality**)
> * strong customisation cues
> * strong autonomy
