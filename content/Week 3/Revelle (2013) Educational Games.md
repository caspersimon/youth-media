# Introduction
Piaget theorized that kids basically develop by constructing their realities through interacting with the world. Then, some other dude, Papert, applied that idea to computers and tech. He argued that development is optimal when kids are literally constructing their own worlds digitally.

# Child Development and Interface Design
With interface we mean the system of hardware (e.g., mouse, joystick) and software functions (e.g., point and click, drag, scroll) used to acces and interact with the game. Children have limited motor and cognitive abilities so that can be a hurdle.
## Strommen (1993) cognitive model of device difficulty


Cognitive load depends on:
1. Degree to which movement with cursor parallels movement in human pointing
2. Number of "rules of use"

His predictions (from easy 1, to hard 4)
1. Touchscreen (he predicted this in 1993)
2. trackball
3. mouse
4. joystick

and the predictions were mostly true!
## The mouse
Because children's reaction times are slower, meaning their information processing times are longer, the theoretically-based prediction is that children's cursor path trajectories to the target would be less direct, less accurate, and take longer than those of adults. 

It was found (in previous research about 4-5 year olds, and about 6-10 year olds) that age significantly affects:
* accuracy
* efficiency
* frequency of target re-entry (overshooting target and then coming back)

Take-away: increasing target size (compared with the target size needed for adults) can improve children's efficiency and accuracy.

## Alternative input devices
There are 3 input devices that are better for children:
### 1. Tangible Interfaces
It is essential that children play with physical objects (like anything, but especially toys) for their cognitive development. "Tangible interfaces provide digital interactivity and contingent feedback through real physical objects that are relevant to the task or game, instead of a mouse with a computer screen" which is good.

Embedding interactivity into physical objects enables children's play with physical toys to be supported, extended, and enhanced by the contingent feedback
and other learning supports that can be provided by digital technology.

However, the effects depend on context and goals of interactive experience. Life, for example, solving a puzzle is easier when it's tangible. As in, children 7-10 were more succesful, faster, and more strategic compared to using a mouse-based input.

However, there have been few empirical validation studies, and even the few that exist have ambiguous results. 

### 2. Touchscreens 
This was predicted! And anecdotal evidence seems to suggest it's true.

However, this article came out in 2013 so it hadn't been studied yet!

### 3. Whole Body Movement
The Wii, Kinect, and other interfaces that detect users' body movements provide another opportunity for more intuitive interaction styles. 

* embodied cognition: the idea that thinking and learning is heavily influenced by the physical form and movement of the human body. Embodied cognition theory (e.g., Wilson, 2002) assumes that the human mind has evolved to learn in physical interaction with the environment, a complementary notion to Piaget's (1952) idea that a central component of cognitive development is infants' and toddlers' coordination of their sensory inputs with motor responses. ^tl93x1

Using whole body movement in games has been linked to:
* increased engagement
* increased social interaction

It could also be good for:
* motor development.
	* Particularly for kids between 3-5: they love jumping around (high motor drive).
	* If motor drive is engaged in a game, this might be good for motor development and cognitive development
* Combatting childhood obesity
	* However, simply introducing these games into families homes (without actually telling them to use the game) didn't have an effect on the activity of children 9-12

Research shows that:
* scaffolding works when teachers use it
* many parents naturally use scaffolding when interacting with their kids
	* This can enhance children's executive function and verbal ability

In games, scaffolding is also effective and has been implemented in two main ways:

![](Definitions/scaffolding.md#How?)

## Motivation
Studies that compare school results between kids motivated by external rewards (performance orientations) like grades or gifts from parents to those of intrinsically motivated students (mastery orientations) like a drive to meet internal goals and found that: 
* those who are intrinsically motivated do better at school in the long run
* those who are intrinsically motivated have better cognitive development

We also know that kids and adolescents play games because they are intrinsically motivating!

--> which prompts the question: what makes games so intrinsically motivating, and how do we bring that into the classroom?
* Some researchers concluded that this "too complex and varied to expect that there would be isolable properties that account for a single motivation to play"
* And yes, other researchers also found that there are multiple motivations for game play, and those motivations relate to developmental stage and cognitive development, and needs of that child at the particular stage.

### Growth vs fixed mindset
I promise it's relevant to games pls bear with me
* some children view intelligence as a fixed quantity of "smartness" 
* others have an incremental or growth view of intelligence that is malleable via effort

Kids with a growth mindset are more likely to:
* to take risks
* try new approaches 
* persist at challenging tasks
--> in turn leads to improved performance

#### How to encourage a growth mindset
* when you praise kids for their effort and progress, this encourages growth mindset
* when you praise kids for their performance on a task or ability, this encourages fixed mindset

**This finding has important implications for the wording of reward messages in children's games.**

# Introduction
The advent of personal computers in the early 1980s brought about
the development of computer software designed specifically for
children. The first widely known effort to apply developmental the-
ory and principles to software for children was that of Seymour Papert.
Early in his career, Papert worked with Piaget, and later applied Piaget's
constructivist theory of development (e.g., Piaget, 1952) to the domain of
learning/interacting with computers, dubbing this approach "construction-
ism" (Papert, 1980). Piaget theorized that children actively "construct"
their own knowledge in interaction with the world around them, progres-
sively internalizing their actions and the results of those actions. Papert
applied that theory to digital learning environments and extended it, argu-
ing that learning (construction of knowledge) is optimized when the
learner is literally constructing or making something in the digital world.
Papert and colleagues' development of the Logo programming lan-
guage (Feurzeig & Papert, 1968) exemplified this approach, enabling chil-
dren to create computer programs. Well-known constructionist projects
that emerged from the thinking of Papert, his colleagues, and his students
include LEGO®Mindstorms (Resnick, Martin, Sargent, & Silverman,
1996), Alan Kay's Squeak (Ingalls, Kaehler, Maloney, Wallace, & Kay,
1997), Mitch Resnick's Scratch (Resnick et al., 2009), computationally-
enhanced construction kits (Eisenberg, Eisenberg, Gross, Kaowthumrong,
Lee, & Lovett, 2002), and the "Children as Design Partners" model of
research and development (Druin, 2002).

# Child development and Interface Design
There has long been an interest in applying developmental knowledge to
interface design (Grover, 1986; Haugland & Shade, 1990). A computer
game's "interface" —the system of hardware (e.g., mouse, joystick, touch-
screen) and software functions (e.g., point-and-click, drag, scroll) used to
access and interact with the game—can serve to either facilitate or hinder
game play. For children, whose motor and cognitive abilities are still
developing, difficulty using the interface can often impede engagement
with the game.
Strommen (1993) proposed a cognitive model of device difficulty, in
which he suggested that there are two additive components of cognitive
load with regard to input device use: the degree to which movement of the
device for cursor control parallels the movements used in human point-
ing, and the number of "rules-of-use" of the device. His analysis predicted
that on initial use, the trackball should be easier to use than the mouse,
which in turn should be easier than the joystick, an ordering that is con-
sistent with results of early empirical studies with children (Jones, 1991;
King & Alloway, 1992; Revelle & Strommen, 1990). Strommen's model predicted that the easiest device for young children to use should be a
touchscreen, foreshadowing by almost two decades the tremendous popu-
larity and success of tablet and mobile touchscreen interfaces for young
children.
## The Mouse. 
Ever since the mouse-driven point-and-click intertace
became standard for computer systems, most of the research has focused
on factors influencing young children's ability to use the mouse (see
reviews by Lane & Ziviani, 1997, 2010). Hourcade, Bederson, Druin
and Guimbretiere (2004) integrated relevant research and theory in the
areas of child development (Kail, 1991) and human-computer interaction
(Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983) to explain the impact of children's devel-
oping cognitive and motor skills on their ability to use the mouse. Because
children's reaction times are slower, meaning their information processing
times are longer, the theoretically-based prediction is that children's cursor
path trajectories to the target would be less direct, less accurate, and take
longer than those of adults. Confirming these predictions, Hourcade and
colleagues (2004) found that age had significant effects on accuracy, effi-
ciency, and frequency of target re-entry (the result of overshooting the tar-
get and then coming back) for 4- and 5-year-olds; Lambert and Bard
(2005) found similar age effects for 6- to 10-year-olds. Both of these stud-
ies, along with Donker and Reitsma (2007), found that increasing target
size (compared with the target size needed for adults) can improve chil-
dren's efficiency and accuracy.

## Alternative Input Devices
There are strong developmental reasons
why certain alternative hardware interfaces are both easier for children
to use and more developmentally appropriate than the mouse. This sec-
tion highlights three intertaces that have particularly child-appropriate
attributes.
### Tangible Interfaces. 
It has long been theorized that young children's
play with physical objects is crucial to cognitive development (cf., Piaget,
1952; Vygotsky, 1978). These objects can include general purpose objects,
such as sticks or rocks that the child uses imaginatively, or objects espe-
cially designed to be toys, like dolls, toy cars, or toy food items.
Tangible interfaces provide digital interactivity and contingent feed-
back through real physical objects that are relevant to the task or game,
instead of a mouse with a computer screen. Researchers have developed a
variety of tangible interfaces for children's interactive experiences (see
review by Zaman, Abeele, Markopoulos, & Marshall, 2012). Embedding
interactivity into physical objects enables children's play with physical
toys to be supported, extended, and enhanced by the contingent feedback
and other learning supports that can be provided by digital technology.
In one direct comparison of children's use of a mouse-based interface
versus a tangible interlace for solving a jigsaw puzzle task, Antle,
Droumeva, and Ha (2009) found that 7- to 10-year-old children were more
successful, faster, and more strategic in their problem solving when using
the tangible interface than with the mouse-based input. However, as
Zaman and colleagues (2012) noted, much of the work on tangible inter-
faces and children has been theoretically driven or design-driven. There
have been few empirical validation studies, and among extant evaluative
studies there are equivocal findings regarding the superiority of tangible
interfaces. As Zaman and colleagues suggest, the advantages or disadvan-
tages of tangible input are likely dependent on the context and goals of the
interactive experience.
### Touchscreens. 
Strommen's previously mentioned cognitive model of
device ditficulty (1993) hypothesized that the touchscreen should be the
easiest interface for young children to use. Since the iPhone and iPad and
other tablet devices have been released, ample anecdotal evidence would
seem to support this prediction. For young children, the recent wide-
spread availability of touchscreen interfaces is of major significance.
For the first time in the history of digital interactivity, there is a com-
monly available interface that very young children can use effectively.
Until now, for the youngest children it didn't really matter that the Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics' (2001, 2011) directives (no "screen time" for
children under age two and a limit of 1-2 hours per day for older chil-
dren) made no distinction between time spent watching linear video ver-
sus time spent engaged in interactivity, since they typically weren't able to
use the interfaces that were available. Now that touchscreens are com-
monly available and seem to be easy for young children to use, there is a
call-to-action for research on the effects (positive and/or negative) of using
various kinds of screen-based interactive applications on young children's
development.
### Whole Body Movement. 
The Wii, Kinect, and other interfaces that
detect users' body movements provide another opportunity for more intui-
tive interaction styles. Engaging children in whole body learning experi-
ences while playing games is consistent with the theoretical construct of
embodied cognition: the idea that thinking and learning is heavily influ-
enced by the physical form and movement of the human body. Embodied
cognition theory (e.g., Wilson, 2002) assumes that the human mind has
evolved to learn in physical interaction with the environment, a comple-
mentary notion to Piaget's (1952) idea that a central component of cogni-
tive development is infants' and toddlers' coordination of their sensory
inputs with motor responses.
From a theoretical perspective, embodied interaction (in which
physical body movements are used to interact with technology) has the
potential to support learning. Researchers have recently built embodied-
interaction systems designed to help young students learn about propor-
tions (Howison, Irninic, Reinholz, & Abrahamson, 2011), numerical
magnitude (Cress, Fischer, Moeller, Sauter, & Nuerk, 2010), and musical
concepts (Antle, Corness, & Droumeva, 2009). The use of full-body phys-
ical movement in game play has also been linked to increased engagement
(Bianchi-Berthouze, Kim, & Patel, 2007; Ibister & DiMauro, 2011) and
social interaction (Lindley, Couteur, & Bianchi-Berthouze, 2008).
Whole-body movement interfaces could also contribute to motor
development. During early childhood, gross motor skills develop rapidly.
Between the ages of 3 and 5, children typically progress from engaging in
simple gross motor events like running or standing on one foot to more
complex activities requiring much greater balance and coordination, like
riding a scooter or skating. During this time, children are described as
having a "high motor drive," meaning that they enjoy engaging in gross
motor activity like jumping, spinning, and running around for the sheer
pleasure of it. To the extent that this high motor drive can be engaged in a
learning game, both motor and cognitive development can be enhanced
There has also been much speculation about the promise of whole-
body movement interfaces to get older children "up off the couch" and
engage them in higher levels of physical activity to help combat the child-
hood obesity epidemic (see Calvert, Staiano, & Bond, this volume). Unfor-
tunately, results of at least one recent study indicate that simply
introducing games that require physical activity into families' homes with-
out any prescription for their use does not lead to increased levels of phys-
ical activity in children ages 9-12 (Baranowski et al., 2012). Further
research is needed examining factors that might lead to better outcomes in
this regard, including investigating how game design might influence chil-
dren's interest and motivation to engage over time in games that require
physical activity.

# Child Development and Game Features
Recent efforts have been made to convey child development information
to game designers and developers. Bekker and Antle (2011) created a set of
"developmentally-situated design cards" to aid developers in understand-
ing the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development of children
in various age groups. Each card also provides examples of activities that
address the skill in age-appropriate fashion. Carla Fisher (e.g., 2012) has
made a number of presentations to convey child development principles to
game designers. This kind of knowledge has positive implications for the
developmental appropriateness of game design and the likelihood that
children in the target age range will enjoy and learn from the game.

## Leveling and Hints/Clues. 
One particularly effective approach to supporting children's learning is via scaffolding, the provision of learning support by a mentor (e.g., Vygotsky, 1978). Scaffolding has been shown to be an effective learning tool when used by teachers (Berk & Winsler, 1995; Bodrova & Leong, 2006). Further, many parents naturally use scaffolding when interacting with their children (Pratt, Green, MacVicar, & Bountrogianni, 1992; Pratt, Kerig, Cowan, & Cowan, 1988), and recent research (Hammond, Muller, Carpendale, Bibok, & Liebermann-Finestone, 2012) indicates that parents' use of scaffolding can enhance children's executive function and verbal ability.

In the context of digital games, scaffolding is a particularly useful
technique for supporting children of varying ability levels in playing the
same game and has frequently been used effectively in educational soft-
ware (Pea, 2004; Revelle, 2003). Scaffolding has been incorporated into
games in two primary ways: leveling and hints or clues. Computer games
almost always include a sequence of game levels that increase in difficulty
as the player becomes more proficient and advances in the game. Learning
is enhanced by increasing the cognitive demands as game levels progress,
rather than simply the demand on psychomotor skills (manual dexterity
or eye-hand coordination). Accordingly, early levels provide more scaf-
folding for children's learning, which is gradually removed as the player
progresses through game levels.
The child's selection of a wrong answer also provides an opportunity
for scaffolding support. When the child makes an incorrect choice, the
game can provide additional support in the form of hints or clues for
approaching the problem. These clues can offer progressively more help
with each subsequent mistake, until the child is capable of solving the
problem. Revelle, Medoff, & Strommen (2001) provide a thorough
description of the process for incorporating scaffolding for learning within
children's educational games.
## Motivation
Ever since there have been computer games, researchers
have been asking what makes them "fun," or intrinsically motivating
(e.g., Malone & Lepper, 1987); that is, why do children want to play them
on their own with no encouragement, prompting, or external motivation?
Much earlier, Deci (1971) argued that some activities provide their own
"inherent" reward, independent of extrinsic rewards to sustain or increase
their occurrence. Well-designed computer games exemplity this type of
activity.

What are the properties of computer games that prompt children to
be intrinsically motivated to play? von Salisch, Oppl, and Kristen (2006)
suggest that children are motivated to select games that address develop-
mental issues that they are facing at the time. An ethnographic study of
video game play in the context of children's real, everyday lives by Stevens,
Satwicz, and McCarthy (2008) concluded that the role of game play is too
complex and varied to expect that there would be isolable properties that
account for a single motivation to play. Olson (2010) takes it a step fur-
ther, examining the multiple motivations for game play and the various
ways in which developmental stage and level of cognitive development
may influence which games are particularly appealing and motivating for
different children, confirming that playing video games serves a diverse
array of needs throughout childhood and adolescence.
Theorists and researchers have compared students with extrinsically
motivated "performance orientations," based on external incentives such
as school grades or parental rewards, to those with intrinsically motivated
"mastery orientations," based on the internal drive to do one's best or to
meet one's own goals. Research (e.g., Anderman, Austin, & Johnson, 2002) shows that long-term school success is greatest for those driven by
intrinsic motivation. Many of the studies reviewed by Jennings & Dietz
(2003) indicate that mastery motivation also enhances cognitive develop-
ment. Accordingly, there have been efforts to understand what is intrinsi-
cally motivating about games, and how to bring those dynamics into the
classroom (e.g., Dickey, 2005; Gee, 2007).

How children perceive the concept of "intelligence" also impacts their
response to challenge, persistence, and performance. According to Dweck
and colleagues (e.g., Dweck & Master, 2009) some children view intelli-
gence as a fixed quantity of "smartness" that is relatively intractable,
whereas others have an incremental or growth view of intelligence that is
malleable via effort. Dweck's research has shown that children with a
growth mind-set are more likely to take risks, try new approaches, and
persist at challenging tasks, all of which lead to improved performance
over the more conservative approaches of those with a fixed mind-set.
Moreover, the wording of praise for children's accomplishments may affect
which mind-set is promoted in development. Praise for one's effort and
progress is more likely to encourage a growth mind-set, whereas praise for
one's task performance or ability is more likely to encourage a fixed mind-
set. This finding has important implications for the wording of reward
messages in children's games.
# Conclusion
Under the approach known as user-centered design, the design of interac-
tive technology takes as its starting point not the capabilities of the tech-
nology but, rather, the needs of its prospective users. In the case of
interactive games for children, informing design with an understanding of
the developmental needs, abilities, and challenges of children in various
age groups can significantly improve the games' usability, appeal, and
eftectiveness, maximizing engagement and learning.
