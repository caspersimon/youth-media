# Evolution of educational media

## [Sesame street](common_terms/Sesame%20street.md) revolution 

Arrival of [Sesame street](common_terms/Sesame%20street.md) in 1969 was a turning point for educational media because of its innovative blend of education and entertainment, coupled up with research-based approach, set a new standard for the field

Its success illustrated he potential of media to teach academic skills and social-emotional concepts effectively. The show’s creators recognized that children learn from media content so it is important to ensure a positive learning experience 

## Educational media today

* Widespread use: media has become a significant part of children’s media consumption. This indicates that children use educational media at younger ages, starting from 4 months old
* Increased marketing targ demographic:
	* e.g. baby einsteins products, baby tv
- Increase in parental emphasis on [Early childhood](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Early%20childhood.md) education:
	- Parents perceive educational media as valuable tool for supporting children’s development

## [Spinach syndrome](Definitions/theories/The%20Spinach%20Syndrome.md)

* Educational media common in [Early childhood](Definitions/Age%20ranges/Early%20childhood.md) but decreases as children get older
* [Spinach syndrome](Definitions/theories/The%20Spinach%20Syndrome.md): observed at 5 years of age when children begin to reject anything perceived as good for them

## How children learn from media- Theoretical frameworks

### Social cognitive theory
Children are more likely to learn from media models they identify with or perceive similar to themselves. Rewarded behaviours more likely to be imitated than punished ones and children learn by observing the consequences of actions

### The Capacity model
Limited capacity of children’s working memory. Education content integrated into narrative better comprehended than content tangential to the story. When educational content and narrative compete for cognitive resources, learning is hindered

### General learning model
Repeated exposure to educational content leads to formation of attitudes and behavioural scripts, influencing real-world actions

## Educational media effects

* **Academic skills**: educational media can enhance literacy, numeracy, and problem-solving skills across different age groups ([infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) to toddlers to older children and teens)
	* Video deficit: [infants](Definitions/Age%20ranges/infants.md) and toddlers might experience this – learning less effectively from screen than from real-life interactions
* **Social-emotional skills**: educational media promote prosocial behaviour, empathy, self-regulation, and social competence in children and adolescents. Programs that promote social interactions and emotional intelligence demonstrate these benefits
* **Creativity:** well-designed educational media can stimulate imaginative play and creative thinking. The “stimulation hypothesis” proposes that media can enrich children’s store of ideas, fostering creative expression

### Key factors influencing learning

also see: [Capacity model (Fisch)](Fisch)).md)
#### Program characteristics:

* **Content complexity** Content that is [moderately discrepant](Definitions/theories/Moderate%20discrepancy%20hypothesis.md) from a child’s existing knowledge is more engaging and effective for learning. This aligns with [Moderate discrepancy hypothesis](Definitions/theories/Moderate%20discrepancy%20hypothesis.md)
* **Narrative structure** Younger children benefit from simple, linear narrative with clear cause-and-effect relationships. Older children can process more complex storylines
* **Participatory cues** Interactive elements encourage active engagement with content, facilitating learning
* **Entertainment value** Making educational media entertaining very important to ensure maintain engagement and sustained attention
#### Child characteristics:
* **Developmental level**: Producers must tailor content to specific cognitive and social-emotional capabilities of their target audience
* **Story schema** Children’s understanding of narrative structure influences comprehension of educational content embedded within a story 
* **Familiarity** Prior knowledge to program, characters and setting can enhance learning

### Gaps in knowledge
* **Age imbalance** Scarcity of educational media targeted at older children and teens, highlighting need for content that appeals to this age group.
  
  Advice would be to draw inspiration from successful healthy communication campaigns and serious games that blend education and entertainment for older audiences

* **Understanding how content works**
  Identifying which children benefit the most and the reasons behind these individual differences will enhance the effectiveness of educational media content
